[{"sentence":"Again, we're glad to have you all here today.","startTime":"00:00","endTime":"00:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this is rethinking startup capital without venture capital.","startTime":"00:04","endTime":"00:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we just wrapped up a panel on the stage where I spoke with three VCs about raising a seed round.","startTime":"00:08","endTime":"00:13","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the general consensus was that the current VC landscape is incredibly competitive right now.","startTime":"00:14","endTime":"00:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And they're not wrong.","startTime":"00:19","endTime":"00:20","speaker_name":"speaker

dollars.","startTime":"00:20","endTime":"00:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this panel is about what happens outside of that 3%.","startTime":"00:29","endTime":"00:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so with that, let's kick things off.","startTime":"00:32","endTime":"00:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Gail, I know we chatted a couple weeks ago about this, but I'd love to hear your take on who is VC really built for and who should probably just avoid it altogether.","startTime":"00:36","endTime":"00:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I always tell founders when you're first starting a company to think about the end state.","startTime":"00:46","endTime":"00:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What is your personal goal for the business?","startTime":"00:51","endTime":"00:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To make an impact, to make money and how to define that.","startTime":"00:53","endTime":"00:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And really on the venture path, we're looking for founders that want to build a huge business.","startTime":"00:57","endTime":"01:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Used to be 100 million in revenue and now it's 300 million in revenue.","startTime":"01:02","endTime":"01:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And do everything it takes to get there.","startTime":"01:05","endTime":"01:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Get there, get there.","startTime":"01:07","endTime":"01:08","speaker_name":"speaker

their life for so many years until they get to the exit.","startTime":"01:11","endTime":"01:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's really the founder that is suited to the VC path.","startTime":"01:14","endTime":"01:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All right.","startTime":"01:18","endTime":"01:18","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And Louis, Eric, do either of you think that there is a time where founders should prioritize going to VCs?","startTime":"01:18","endTime":"01:24","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm more on the operating side of that question, so I don't know.","startTime":"01:26","endTime":"01:29","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I would say as a family office, next generation, I think that for us it's really important to build that relationship with founders.","startTime":"01:30","endTime":"01:41","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so if you have the time to build that foundation and relationship from, let's say months or years back, then sure, come to us.","startTime":"01:41","endTime":"01:50","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But then if you're looking for a really crunch time, then maybe going to venture might be a suitable path.","startTime":"01:50","endTime":"01:57","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The reason I say that is because I always like to think investing in people or things or founders who I can learn from and so it can have this giving relationship.","startTime":"01:57","endTime":"02:08","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So yeah.","startTime":"02:08","endTime":"02:09","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so Louis, we'll stick on you for a second here.","startTime":"02:09","endTime":"02:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for anyone that's unfamiliar, family offices generally manage the wealth of ultra high net worth families and increasingly are getting more involved in startup capital.","startTime":"02:11","endTime":"02:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I'd love for you to give us some perspective into why should a founder choose to take family office money over maybe angel or VC money.","startTime":"02:19","endTime":"02:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"02:29","endTime":"02:29","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So for us, we are a little bit more hands on in terms of who we invest in and basically our portfolio companies.","startTime":"02:29","endTime":"02:38","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So if you do like more of like a good hands on, collaborative, strategic type of, I would say investors, then definitely come to, let's say family offices because each family office is different in how they invest and they really hold on to their values and their thesis and who they invest in.","startTime":"02:38","endTime":"02:57","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so it becomes very narrow of also who we invest in.","startTime":"02:57","endTime":"03:01","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But I would say be ready to really build a relationship with us.","startTime":"03:01","endTime":"03:07","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And Gail, as angel, you invest your own money into startups.","startTime":"03:09","endTime":"03:13","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So give us your pitch for why founders should take angel money over different forms of capital.","startTime":"03:13","endTime":"03:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Quick background on me.","startTime":"03:18","endTime":"03:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I started Irish Angels, Notre Dame's angel group in 2012.","startTime":"03:20","endTime":"03:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I've done 40 million in syndicates and I've done 40 million through my funds that vitalize as a VC and then done personal investing.","startTime":"03:23","endTime":"03:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I actually think angel is a great strategy for nearly all founders up front because it leaves your options open.","startTime":"03:30","endTime":"03:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So as angel, I think very differently about placing my capital than I do as the steward of my LP capital on behalf of my vitalized limited partners.","startTime":"03:38","endTime":"03:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What I mean by that is I can be personally interested in you and your business and invest solely because of that, whereas a vc, I have to think about that math.","startTime":"03:47","endTime":"03:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can you hit 300 million of revenue?","startTime":"03:58","endTime":"04:00","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can I underwrite at least a 30x return cash on cash for this deal, Whereas some of my angel deals, it might be 5x10x20x and those are still really great outcomes for both me and the founder versus the vendor side.","startTime":"04:00","endTime":"04:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's definitely a huge world where angel makes sense.","startTime":"04:13","endTime":"04:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All right.","startTime":"04:17","endTime":"04:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And Eric, as a Bootstrap founder, you didn't take anybody's money.","startTime":"04:17","endTime":"04:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, tried.","startTime":"04:21","endTime":"04:22","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Tell us about it.","startTime":"04:23","endTime":"04:24","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Tell us about your VC experience and what made you end up bootstrapping in the end.","startTime":"04:24","endTime":"04:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, were trying to raise money to do a chess business, which is as silly as it sounds, 20 years ago especially.","startTime":"04:27","endTime":"04:34","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you know, there were people who were like, yeah, I like chess, but like this is not an investable business.","startTime":"04:35","endTime":"04:39","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's never going to be a big business.","startTime":"04:39","endTime":"04:41","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like you should probably go do something else and this is like a hobby and you know, maybe in a different multiverse, they were right.","startTime":"04:41","endTime":"04:49","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But it worked out a little differently for us.","startTime":"04:49","endTime":"04:51","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you know, we sit in a strange place of, you know, being a fairly large company now in terms of revenue, like having not taken the capital.","startTime":"04:51","endTime":"04:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But it was unusual for a couple of different reasons.","startTime":"04:57","endTime":"05:00","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"One is, wasn't a lot of competition in the Chess space at the time.","startTime":"05:00","endTime":"05:05","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we had a lot longer time to operate and kind of figure things out and like move and pivot and you know, grow at the speed of cash rather than like massive, you know, investment.","startTime":"05:05","endTime":"05:15","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Even though we've compounded, I think, you know, 40 some percent every single year since the inception, which now, you know, is great and looks good.","startTime":"05:15","endTime":"05:22","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, we didn't, that wasn't true.","startTime":"05:23","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, for the first 12 years was slower.","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:27","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It was good, but it wasn't the same.","startTime":"05:27","endTime":"05:29","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So, you know, the other thing is we reach profitability early and I think a lot of people don't strive for that.","startTime":"05:30","endTime":"05:36","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so they're, you know, they're doing, making different decisions.","startTime":"05:36","endTime":"05:39","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But we did work toward that.","startTime":"05:39","endTime":"05:41","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We needed the cash of profitability and a business model that supported that in order to buy us the time and to enter.","startTime":"05:41","endTime":"05:46","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"05:47","endTime":"05:47","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So last time we chatted, I believe you mentioned that you also bootstrapped Chess.com with money from selling a previous company.","startTime":"05:48","endTime":"05:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so give us an idea of what is the nest egg that a founder should have to bootstrap their company.","startTime":"05:54","endTime":"05:58","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Are we talking tens of thousands, Hundreds of thousands?","startTime":"05:58","endTime":"06:00","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"More.","startTime":"06:00","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, over the initial years@chess.com, i put in $700,000 of my own money and it's like, well, that's not really bootstrapping in some ways.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:10","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I mean, I just happen to have my own money there.","startTime":"06:10","endTime":"06:13","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's a privilege that I acknowledge.","startTime":"06:14","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And not everyone has access to that, but it was built upon two other very small business exits.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:22","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So what would you recommend for founders who don't have that capital sitting around, how to get started bootstrapping?","startTime":"06:22","endTime":"06:26","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, we also like did a whole bunch of moonlighting and late night work.","startTime":"06:26","endTime":"06:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I mean, I was in business school.","startTime":"06:30","endTime":"06:32","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"My co founder had a full time job and you know, I would drive to his house at 5pm and then we would work until 3am and that's kind of how things went for about a year and a half.","startTime":"06:32","endTime":"06:41","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Hustle, Hustle.","startTime":"06:41","endTime":"06:43","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Spect.","startTime":"06:43","endTime":"06:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Great.","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And Gail, tell us a little bit about some of the companies that you back.","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What type of founder are you generally looking for?","startTime":"06:49","endTime":"06:51","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The VC or the angel side?","startTime":"06:52","endTime":"06:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Angel side.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"06:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"On the angel side.","startTime":"06:54","endTime":"06:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm going to answer this a little bit differently to make it more prescriptive.","startTime":"06:56","endTime":"06:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just in the audience, who's a founder looking to raise money somehow for your business?","startTime":"06:59","endTime":"07:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"07:03","endTime":"07:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I do a ton of advising on this and I always ask questions around what your goals are.","startTime":"07:05","endTime":"07:11","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And founders will always ask me, can you make Introductions to these various angels.","startTime":"07:11","endTime":"07:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I say no, because the really the important thing for you to figure out is who is it that makes sense to be angel for your business.","startTime":"07:15","endTime":"07:24","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They've exited companies in your space, corporates currently working as VPs and C level in your space.","startTime":"07:24","endTime":"07:31","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They live in your geo.","startTime":"07:31","endTime":"07:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They know you.","startTime":"07:32","endTime":"07:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's some connection that you have.","startTime":"07:33","endTime":"07:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They might have gone to your school or your church or whatever.","startTime":"07:35","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, what are all of the ways that you can create a system for going after potential angels?","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then when you meet with them, because you have that common tie, whether it's living in the same place, gone to the same school, knowing the same industry, that bond is really what angel's looking for in order to find something that they get excited about.","startTime":"07:43","endTime":"07:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you want to spend a ton of time, more than you want, finding that right list of angels and then figuring out how to reach out to them in a way that makes sense and is meaningful to them.","startTime":"07:58","endTime":"08:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is the best way that you can spend your time.","startTime":"08:07","endTime":"08:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you asked me, angel or VC perspective, What's the difference between your VC perspective?","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:15","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So from a VC perspective, you know, I have limited funds, I invest in so few companies, which is a little bit different on the angels side.","startTime":"08:15","endTime":"08:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, somebody that's a VP of a marketing technology firm might not be hit up as much as I am.","startTime":"08:23","endTime":"08:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every day I get about 20 full emails from founders all over the world that don't even read what I do.","startTime":"08:29","endTime":"08:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But they see VC and so they reach out to me.","startTime":"08:34","endTime":"08:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have to think about, like, if you go after VC capital, you really need a warm intro to cut through the noise or a way to reach out that makes sense.","startTime":"08:36","endTime":"08:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I do answer some cold emails.","startTime":"08:45","endTime":"08:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's just really rare because founders aren't spending the time to go beyond canned AI crap that makes no sense to me.","startTime":"08:47","endTime":"08:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's a really different way.","startTime":"08:57","endTime":"08:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Whereas if somebody comes up at an event and they're like, hey, I'm with Grangels.","startTime":"08:58","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like, I like pet tech personally.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I do some of those deals and they know that I run a dog rescue and they're like, hey, I've been following her.","startTime":"09:05","endTime":"09:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I read your book on pet loss screen.","startTime":"09:09","endTime":"09:11","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm going to talk to that founder and I'm really going to try to help them because I'm interested in the same thing that they are.","startTime":"09:11","endTime":"09:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Whereas on the VC side, it's like, I don't have time to deal with anything except what's going to make money from Iops.","startTime":"09:17","endTime":"09:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Interesting.","startTime":"09:24","endTime":"09:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"09:25","endTime":"09:26","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so, Louis, I Feel like family office has always felt a bit mysterious to me.","startTime":"09:26","endTime":"09:30","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe I'm not the only one here.","startTime":"09:30","endTime":"09:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But can you tell us a bit about how you go about finding founders to back?","startTime":"09:31","endTime":"09:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"09:35","endTime":"09:36","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So I think network and community is definitely going to be top of the priority list.","startTime":"09:36","endTime":"09:40","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But also talking about co investment opportunities are super duper important as well.","startTime":"09:41","endTime":"09:45","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so when, let's say a different family office, my mentor and whatnot are talking about different investments, you kind of want to take a look at those.","startTime":"09:45","endTime":"09:54","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Because in a way, if you are talking to those people in your network, within family offices and interested in that sector, then it's only natural that you're going to be interested in kind of diving deep into who the founders really are really doing the due diligence kind of in the background.","startTime":"09:54","endTime":"10:11","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But it's funny because you're talking to other family offices.","startTime":"10:11","endTime":"10:15","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So in my perspective, they've already done a lot of the due diligence.","startTime":"10:15","endTime":"10:18","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So in a way it really does cut through the noise.","startTime":"10:18","endTime":"10:20","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The only thing that I have to do would go through essentially my team and do another double due diligence from my thesis and from my perspective of what Caldwell's Capital stands for.","startTime":"10:20","endTime":"10:31","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so it's like kind of this really overarching theme of trying to be around the right people, but the community really lives in a way.","startTime":"10:31","endTime":"10:42","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And how should founders go about finding a family office if they're interested in that kind of capital?","startTime":"10:43","endTime":"10:47","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, is there a list somewhere?","startTime":"10:47","endTime":"10:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Where do they go?","startTime":"10:48","endTime":"10:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's not a list, but like Gail mentioned, it's like really caring about what you essentially do outside of just what your company has built.","startTime":"10:50","endTime":"10:59","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So tapping into maybe like experts within the field, because we're most likely talking to experts as well.","startTime":"10:59","endTime":"11:07","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I like to say, I like to surround myself with PhD students or just PhD because they've already know what's really in the field.","startTime":"11:07","endTime":"11:14","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so the only thing I have to think about, okay, is if this is an investable ip.","startTime":"11:14","endTime":"11:19","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But then I would say that's kind of like how I would say.","startTime":"11:19","endTime":"11:24","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But each I would say person approaches it differently.","startTime":"11:24","endTime":"11:27","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But I would say from experts.","startTime":"11:27","endTime":"11:28","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And Eric, were there ever times where you were interested or looking into taking family office for angel money?","startTime":"11:29","endTime":"11:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, maybe angel who's a chess fanatic themselves.","startTime":"11:35","endTime":"11:38","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I did at the beginning.","startTime":"11:38","endTime":"11:39","speaker_name":"speaker

checks for like very large percentages of the business early on.","startTime":"11:46","endTime":"11:50","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you know, weren't that desperate to do.","startTime":"11:50","endTime":"11:52","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"To do it at that time.","startTime":"11:52","endTime":"11:53","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But we have spoken to some family offices over the time is it's been inbound interest or, you know, we eventually did take on an investor who wasn't, you know, who bought secondary, so not, you know, infusion of cash, but did come in and then they traded out, and then there was someone else, and then were at a scale.","startTime":"11:53","endTime":"12:08","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We had to start talking to family offices.","startTime":"12:08","endTime":"12:10","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So, you know, we've talked to them, and I think it's a great avenue because, again, it's like more values aligned a little bit.","startTime":"12:10","endTime":"12:15","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think, you know, people are a little bit naive or just kind of don't want to look at the fact that, like, taking institutional capital is almost certainly, like, now puts you in, like, a little bit of diverging incentives about what you're trying to do.","startTime":"12:15","endTime":"12:29","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so I think family offices can get you closer to that convergence.","startTime":"12:30","endTime":"12:34","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And tell us about some of the decisions that you were able to make because you didn't have that VC oversight.","startTime":"12:34","endTime":"12:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think one main one is that basically when investors told us that they weren't interested in us, it kind of, like, took all the pressure off of that ever being something.","startTime":"12:40","endTime":"12:53","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I just ignored all investors.","startTime":"12:53","endTime":"12:55","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I never thought about fundraising.","startTime":"12:55","endTime":"12:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I never thought about any of

product.","startTime":"13:00","endTime":"13:01","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think that, like, too many people spend all this time and energy, like, around fundraising

them.","startTime":"13:02","endTime":"13:17","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Rather than just build your shit and get it done and work hard, and then, like, eventually, once

around.","startTime":"13:26","endTime":"13:28","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But too many people are enamored with investors and raising money and being near successful people, and, oh, I need this advisor.","startTime":"13:28","endTime":"13:36","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But really, just go do your vision and execute really well and you'll figure it out.","startTime":"13:36","endTime":"13:41","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, some people feel like fundraising is like success, but fundraising, that's like saying surgery is success.","startTime":"13:41","endTime":"13:47","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like it was a solution to a problem you had, not, like the other way

business.","startTime":"14:20","endTime":"14:31","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not that many people should raise

have?","startTime":"14:44","endTime":"14:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would say for us we do depending on which who the founder is and what they're trying to achieve within the world.","startTime":"14:47","endTime":"14:54","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Really each deal is independent in that kind of way.","startTime":"14:55","endTime":"14:58","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That's why when people come to me and say, okay, like what do you like, how do you guys structure deals?","startTime":"14:58","endTime":"15:02","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's really independent to like who the founder is.","startTime":"15:02","endTime":"15:06","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So mainly I would say depending on how big the deal size is, I would like to take certain like equity and all that.","startTime":"15:06","endTime":"15:13","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But mainly it's really building that core relationship with the founder and kind of like you said, nitty gritty down to the ground of like what the work looks like.","startTime":"15:13","endTime":"15:23","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Because I'm not necessarily thinking about, you know, taking a cut or X, Y and Z and all that because for me it's important that I know the person well and that I can also support in a way and like learn from each other and kind of also have them in my community.","startTime":"15:23","endTime":"15:41","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Because when you bring someone in the family office community, your reputation kind of also precedes itself.","startTime":"15:41","endTime":"15:47","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so they only, the founders also only gain success from really being in one with the family office that they work with because they get to be part of the family office community as well.","startTime":"15:47","endTime":"16:00","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That's interesting that you say that.","startTime":"16:01","endTime":"16:02","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'm curious because I often see or assume that family offices tend to invest in sort of impact or mission driven companies.","startTime":"16:02","endTime":"16:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you think that's representative of most family offices or what does it have to do with the reputation you mentioned?","startTime":"16:09","endTime":"16:15","speaker_name":"speaker

wealth.","startTime":"16:15","endTime":"16:25","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But for us it would be mainly from.","startTime":"16:27","endTime":"16:30","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So a little bit about me.","startTime":"16:30","endTime":"16:31","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I was a professional athlete and so what we invest in is wellness and wellness tech.","startTime":"16:31","endTime":"16:36","speaker_name":"speaker

office does it really differently.","startTime":"16:39","endTime":"16:41","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"They do private equity, hedge fund, real estate, like hospitality, really different.","startTime":"16:41","endTime":"16:45","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so I think each family office is very different in that kind of way.","startTime":"16:46","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so let's take a step back and circle back to this idea of just getting shit done and building the thing.","startTime":"16:52","endTime":"16:58","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Gail, last time we chatted you mentioned that you would like to be a fairly hands off angel

angels.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you think angels tend to be hands off?","startTime":"17:09","endTime":"17:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's really a mix and there's a lot of different types of angels.","startTime":"17:12","endTime":"17:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For example, the syndicate work that I do, I let people write as small of a check as $5,000 and invest through my syndicate into companies.","startTime":"17:16","endTime":"17:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can have angels write 250 or $500,000 checks as super angels and behave a little bit more like an institutional check writer.","startTime":"17:24","endTime":"17:31","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you have an institutional style angel, they might be a little bit more involved like a small VC fund would be at the early stage.","startTime":"17:32","endTime":"17:39","speaker_name":"speaker

size is small.","startTime":"17:58","endTime":"17:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not really until I'm a VC and then I'm watching their metrics and then I have to reach out and say, hey, your cash position is getting low.","startTime":"17:59","endTime":"18:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have to talk about this.","startTime":"18:06","endTime":"18:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's interesting because, you know, for VCs, a lot of the reason founders go to VCs is for that support, right?","startTime":"18:08","endTime":"18:13","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Opening the Rolodex of customers help with hiring and VCs use it as sort of a way to differentiate.","startTime":"18:13","endTime":"18:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I'm curious, with angels, how do you sort of pitch your value to founders in a competition with other.","startTime":"18:19","endTime":"18:26","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The dirty secret of all this, who likes who.","startTime":"18:27","endTime":"18:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm excited about this pet tech

angels.","startTime":"18:37","endTime":"18:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's that inspiration and that magic and we want to lean in because we're so excited about what you're building.","startTime":"18:40","endTime":"18:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yes, naturally we're going to help.","startTime":"18:45","endTime":"18:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think a lot of times, you know, founders expect a lot from VCs and angels, but really back to Eric's.","startTime":"18:47","endTime":"18:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The best founders are just going to build it because they know what they want to build.","startTime":"18:55","endTime":"18:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And those are the founders that I want to underwrite back because I believe in them, I believe in their vision to do it.","startTime":"18:58","endTime":"19:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so tell us, how should founders go about finding angel that is that excited to work with them?","startTime":"19:04","endTime":"19:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because that sounds like a dream partnership.","startTime":"19:08","endTime":"19:10","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But where are they?","startTime":"19:10","endTime":"19:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What I would do is take a weekend and start with LinkedIn.","startTime":"19:12","endTime":"19:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So back to what I was saying earlier.","startTime":"19:16","endTime":"19:18","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Your school, any community throughout your location, your industry is a big one.","startTime":"19:18","endTime":"19:24","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And start to make lists.","startTime":"19:24","endTime":"19:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is where I would leverage AI help.","startTime":"19:26","endTime":"19:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let AI help you make the list.","startTime":"19:28","endTime":"19:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What you don't want to outsource to AI is actually getting to know them.","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"19:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Read the blog posts that they've written and the podcasts they're on.","startTime":"19:34","endTime":"19:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Listen to them, figure out what's important to them, what they like to talk about, what they are already investing in.","startTime":"19:38","endTime":"19:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And oftentimes when you get really excited about somebody and you're leaning in, they're going to do the same.","startTime":"19:44","endTime":"19:49","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When you can finally get in front of them, that's really what you're looking for.","startTime":"19:49","endTime":"19:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a shorter list of higher potential check writers versus what a lot of founders do is let me buy a list of thousands of email addresses and they send them out and it just doesn't work anymore.","startTime":"19:53","endTime":"20:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Interesting.","startTime":"20:06","endTime":"20:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let's shift gears a little bit to talking about going forward.","startTime":"20:07","endTime":"20:10","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would love to hear sort of what all of you are interested in right

product.","startTime":"20:18","endTime":"20:21","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's kind of what I focus

3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the terminal endpoints for companies is just really strange right now.","startTime":"20:40","endTime":"20:45","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like going public is harder than ever.","startTime":"20:45","endTime":"20:47","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, you have to have so much revenue plus an insane growth rate or no one will look at you.","startTime":"20:47","endTime":"20:51","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, then you have a bunch of large companies that kind of buy your company and then destroy value and ruin your vision and everything like that.","startTime":"20:52","endTime":"20:59","speaker_name":"speaker

money, but now you're just kicking the can down the road because that person wants a 3x return and then they'll sell it and they'll squeeze you and then make you look good and then sell it and then

of like a very bad, you know, cycle there.","startTime":"21:17","endTime":"21:20","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so maybe more.","startTime":"21:20","endTime":"21:22","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I hope there's more family offices.","startTime":"21:22","endTime":"21:24","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I hope there's more values aligned things.","startTime":"21:24","endTime":"21:26","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I would love that if were an economy where people were putting money to work for like the end value of humanity rather than just the ROI and you know, the CAGR or whatever that stuff is.","startTime":"21:26","endTime":"21:37","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But I don't know how to make that transition.","startTime":"21:37","endTime":"21:40","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So let me know when we figure it out.","startTime":"21:40","endTime":"21:43","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Sounds like you got the support.","startTime":"21:43","endTime":"21:44","speaker_name":"speaker

days?","startTime":"21:49","endTime":"21:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so two things.","startTime":"21:50","endTime":"21:52","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Caldas Capital does a lot of M and A acquisitions as well of early emerging wellness companies, but they have to be cash flowing because essentially what I want to do is to create a business ecosystem that is wellness themed.","startTime":"21:53","endTime":"22:08","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But then the second part I'm also interested in is wellness tech and how we can essentially have high performing aspects but from a non doping mechanism.","startTime":"22:08","endTime":"22:17","speaker_name":"speaker

in?","startTime":"22:29","endTime":"22:30","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the deals that I've done most recently are on the venture side and personally I think that data is more important than AI.","startTime":"22:31","endTime":"22:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's really trying to lean into companies that have a unique angle on generating proprietary data because I think long term that's going to be where the value is.","startTime":"22:37","endTime":"22:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All the AI, the LLMs, will revert to the mean in terms of the value that can be added there so that the data becomes really important.","startTime":"22:46","endTime":"22:53","speaker_name":"speaker

that take, like how much energy that takes.","startTime":"32:50","endTime":"32:58","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so we understand that.","startTime":"32:58","endTime":"33:00","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so there's a lot of ways to collaborate then at least for family offices to kind of suck to you instead of another founder who does something very different.","startTime":"33:00","endTime":"33:08","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So I think really own in on that mission
