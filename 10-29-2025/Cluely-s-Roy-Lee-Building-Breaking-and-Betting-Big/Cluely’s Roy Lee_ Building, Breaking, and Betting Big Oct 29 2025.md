# Cluely’s Roy Lee: Building, Breaking, and Betting Big

October 29, 2025, 03:05 pm

## Notes

### **Distribution and Marketing Strategy**
- The core belief driving **Clulee's success** is that **distribution is everything**, and effective viral marketing outweighs traditional product-first approaches according to **Roy Lee** (01:00).  
- Roy’s early pivot from a failing B2B product to viral content like **Interview Coder**, which hit **1 million views**, proved that grabbing attention first can create a foothold for product discovery.  
- He emphasized that social media today demands extreme differentiation to stand out, as ordinary marketing fails in an over-saturated environment (05:00).  
- Roy’s style is authentic and hyperbolic, which naturally creates controversy and attracts attention, rejecting typical brand safety concerns (06:30).  
- The marketing approach splits into two: **top-of-funnel viral reach** to seed awareness and **bottom-of-funnel product-driven conversion**, both required for success (08:30).
- Roy warns that many startups die not from product failure but from lack of distribution, stressing the need for a “hard focus” on getting seen if the product solves even a small problem (14:30).  
- He delegates marketing tasks to others when possible, allowing him to focus more on product without losing momentum (14:50).  
- Viral marketing is a tool for survival and growth, especially for startups without massive resources or brand recognition like Mr. Beast (16:00).  
- The risk of everyone using viral content strategies is mitigated by rapid saturation; only the best marketing and products win long term (17:30).
### **Product Development and Launch Lessons**
- Clulee’s launch was intentionally premature, trading product readiness for viral momentum, which caused significant **technical debt** and product challenges post-launch (11:50).  
- Roy acknowledges that the product barely worked for the first **three weeks**, leading to slower development velocity as the team maintains backward compatibility (12:00).  
- Early users organically discovered unexpected use cases, mainly using Clulee for **professional meeting notes**, which has since become the product’s focus (13:30).  
- Roy believes most companies in a space eventually converge on the “most optimal” solution, suggesting product evolution is often a natural narrowing process (13:40).  
- Despite the early launch struggles, Roy sees value in launching fast and iterating based on power user feedback (12:30).
### **User Engagement and Metrics**
- Clulee’s retention rate has improved **3x since launch**, reflecting stronger user engagement as the product stabilized (10:55).  
- Roy chooses not to share exact revenue or user count metrics publicly to avoid fueling competitor comparisons or negative criticism (10:00).  
- He highlights that viral impressions alone don’t guarantee conversions; product quality must back up marketing for sustained growth (09:40).  
- Distribution efforts generate awareness, but retention and word-of-mouth stem from product satisfaction and real value (14:30).  
- The balance between viral reach and product quality is critical for converting millions of views into lasting users (15:00).
### **Platform-Specific Content and Competitive Insights**
- Roy stresses tailoring content to platform differences: **Twitter favors captions and horizontal videos**, while **Instagram and TikTok require vertical, watchable videos** to capture slower, low-consciousness scroll behavior (22:30).  
- Twitter users engage more thoughtfully, making it ideal for complex B2B onboarding or desktop apps (23:45).  
- He advises startups to avoid generic presence on unsuitable platforms, instead focusing marketing efforts where the target audience’s attention level matches the product complexity (24:10).  
- Roy refutes the idea that ragebait is necessary; differentiation, whether controversial or authentic, drives engagement better (24:50).  
- He points out that many companies fail to produce quality content consistently, which is why few replicate Clulee’s viral success (18:00).
- Roy also analyzes competitors’ marketing:  
- **OpenAI** uses Sam Altman’s timeline presence to stir interest and fear around AGI, gaining attention without fully developed products (20:40).  
- **Anthropic** generates controversy with dire AI job predictions but lags in user count compared to OpenAI, illustrating the impact of content frequency and product strength (21:00).  
- He notes Andrew Tate’s success came from sheer volume of content, not just style, highlighting the importance of persistence (21:20).  
- Political figures like **Donald Trump** exemplify the same viral playbook of differentiation and engagement (21:50).
### **Long-Term Vision and Market Positioning**
- Roy frames Clulee’s future around hedging for both AI advancement and plateau scenarios, positioning Clulee as either the best **AI note taker** or a broad AI augmentation layer depending on model improvements (26:05).  
- If AI models plateau, Clulee aims to dominate the AI note-taking space by refining features for consumer use (26:15).  
- If models improve dramatically (e.g., GPT7-level), Clulee’s translucent overlay interface will expand into a wider AI productivity tool that augments all computer work (26:20).  
- Roy admits this dual-path strategy is unusual and draws criticism for prioritizing marketing over traditional product development but defends it as necessary for survival (27:20).  
- He challenges the common startup advice that product alone drives success, citing many failed startups that lacked strong marketing despite good products (27:40).  
- Roy’s long-term philosophy embraces a mix of authentic marketing, rapid iteration, and strategic product focus to build a generational company adaptable to AI’s evolving landscape (17:00; 26:00).
