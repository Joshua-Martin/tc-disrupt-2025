there.","startTime":"11:27","endTime":"11:29","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"11:29","endTime":"11:29","speaker_name":"speaker

question.","startTime":"11:32","endTime":"11:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean you've mentioned this before that you basically created the launch video for Cluli with just kind of the idea and then kind of made the product work after which actually I don't.","startTime":"11:33","endTime":"11:43","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think you're just pretty honest about that.","startTime":"11:43","endTime":"11:44","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think a lot of startups do that.","startTime":"11:44","endTime":"11:45","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But talk to me about like working kind of backwards from getting distribution and then the product.","startTime":"11:45","endTime":"11:53","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think if there's.","startTime":"11:54","endTime":"11:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh man, I can't even say if it's a mistake.","startTime":"11:56","endTime":"11:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But one thing that I wonder is maybe the could have launched too early because like real, like just for the first three weeks, like even if you downloaded it, like you realistically just could not use it.","startTime":"11:59","endTime":"12:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And right now a lot of the reason for lower product velocity right now than I would like is because we're suffering from a lot of tech debt from a quick launch and then now we have to maintain backwards compatibility with all like the random bullshit frameworks that we added just because things are going down so fast.","startTime":"12:11","endTime":"12:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think there is such a thing as launching too early.","startTime":"12:26","endTime":"12:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But also like, I mean we did like the coolie launch, like how can I say?","startTime":"12:30","endTime":"12:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like oh, I regret like being in this viral like it did well for us.","startTime":"12:33","endTime":"12:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do you think you bit off more than you could chew with the launch video?","startTime":"12:40","endTime":"12:43","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"No, I don't think so.","startTime":"12:43","endTime":"12:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think like people don't give a.","startTime":"12:44","endTime":"12:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"People don't care.","startTime":"12:45","endTime":"12:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But at the end of the day it's like, oh, it's like a good, good product for sending follow up emails.","startTime":"12:45","endTime":"12:49","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like I'll use it for that.","startTime":"12:49","endTime":"12:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, at the end of the day, if you just get like a couple thousand users, like, they will find you.","startTime":"12:51","endTime":"12:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Use cases for you.","startTime":"12:54","endTime":"12:55","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that was the whole idea, is let's launch something that barely works.","startTime":"12:55","endTime":"13:00","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then if we can get enough initial users, like, they will become the power users, they will find out the use cases for us.","startTime":"13:00","endTime":"13:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that is what ended up happening.","startTime":"13:07","endTime":"13:08","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like, our core power group of users is just people who have tried it and experienced, like, very different things than we expected them to.","startTime":"13:08","endTime":"13:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's the whole reason why we ended up narrowing stuff.","startTime":"13:15","endTime":"13:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, well, everyone's using this for professional readings.","startTime":"13:17","endTime":"13:18","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's what the power users have told you, is that they just want to use it for meetings.","startTime":"13:21","endTime":"13:23","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Well, they just do use it for meetings.","startTime":"13:23","endTime":"13:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, all right.","startTime":"13:25","endTime":"13:27","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's what you're building towards now.","startTime":"13:27","endTime":"13:28","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's this.","startTime":"13:29","endTime":"13:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is another thing.","startTime":"13:31","endTime":"13:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't know if this is inevitable.","startTime":"13:32","endTime":"13:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm beginning to think that perhaps every company that lands in a space, everyone just sort of like radially descends down to the most optimal version of the solution.","startTime":"13:34","endTime":"13:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which is why, like Instagram Reels, TikTok and YouTube shorts all look the same.","startTime":"13:45","endTime":"13:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, perhaps that is true and perhaps it is also the case that the day Hulu launched and were destined to end that payroll, whether we talked to a bunch of users or whether we got super viral and used the usage data, I'm not sure though these are still things that I'm figuring out.","startTime":"13:48","endTime":"14:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, like, now you're in the thick of it.","startTime":"14:07","endTime":"14:09","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like when the launch video went out, like, you know, and you had something like the viral stunts where you like hired 50 interns to like just be influencers, you know, that was in a much earlier stage.","startTime":"14:09","endTime":"14:20","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Now you're like, okay, you got some users, you're trying to grow them.","startTime":"14:20","endTime":"14:23","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Do you feel like the focus on distribution, like the influencers that you guys have, like the focus on social media is a distraction now from actually building the thing?","startTime":"14:23","endTime":"14:33","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"No, no.","startTime":"14:33","endTime":"14:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the reason is because you can just hire people to do it for you.","startTime":"14:34","endTime":"14:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, well, right now I can spend a lot of my time, like not doing that thing.","startTime":"14:37","endTime":"14:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And Apple marketing channels, I can just one to one, give to other people.","startTime":"14:42","endTime":"14:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think this is something that every startup probably needs to think about more because there's just so many startups that die because they could have pmf, but they don't find it because they can't get seen by users.","startTime":"14:46","endTime":"14:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In fact, I know probably four products off the top of my Head.","startTime":"14:59","endTime":"15:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That would be crazy.","startTime":"15:02","endTime":"15:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's copy all of their ui, but they're not seen by anybody.","startTime":"15:06","endTime":"15:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they get fucking like less than 1% of the web traffic has this.","startTime":"15:09","endTime":"15:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're just going to get steamrolled.","startTime":"15:12","endTime":"15:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think like, realistically most startups do not die because like the product is not there.","startTime":"15:13","endTime":"15:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like if you're in a problem space and you think you're like solving something, even the tiniest problem, like there's money to be made there, you gotta be die because you can't find the money.","startTime":"15:20","endTime":"15:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And people just need a hard focus.","startTime":"15:28","endTime":"15:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like I think generally if you're not in deep tech, then you need a low key hard focus on building distribution.","startTime":"15:30","endTime":"15:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If your problem even remotely solved, remotely solves the problem that you're trying to.","startTime":"15:36","endTime":"15:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You got to get in front of people, bro.","startTime":"15:40","endTime":"15:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But like, if you guys have like millions of views like on X, on TikTok, on Instagram, but you don't have millions of users, like, I mean like talk to me about like conversion because to me it's like if people see it and then the product's good, they'll convert into lasting users theory, right?","startTime":"15:42","endTime":"15:59","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like so why not just focus more on building the product now?","startTime":"15:59","endTime":"16:03","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because like you are still, I mean you might hire people to do it, but like you're in the TikToks, like you're, you know, clearly like still part of it.","startTime":"16:03","endTime":"16:11","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, right.","startTime":"16:11","endTime":"16:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'd say like the world is so much bigger than people think.","startTime":"16:12","endTime":"16:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And even if you spend okay as an extreme, if Mr.","startTime":"16:15","endTime":"16:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Beast started any company and just gave you a blank term sheet, he didn't mean to tell you the

company.","startTime":"16:26","endTime":"16:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like what Postma?","startTime":"16:27","endTime":"16:28","speaker_name":"speaker

2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I trust him.","startTime":"16:32","endTime":"16:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So obviously at an extreme, everyone believes that if you have enough distribution, it doesn't really matter.","startTime":"16:33","endTime":"16:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can just teammate yourself.","startTime":"16:37","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And right now like there's a big, like it might not seem like that in tech, but there's a big

right now, which why you see me tweet a lot less.","startTime":"16:50","endTime":"16:57","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But like there's sure there's like a globally optimal thing to do, but there's like a hundred Other really great things you can do.","startTime":"16:57","endTime":"17:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's many roads to building a generational company and one of the roads is could theoretically.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like maybe the globally optimal strategy is just fucking spend the next five years Mr. Beasting yourself and then build a company.","startTime":"17:10","endTime":"17:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And maybe in that five years like your momentum and building the distribution will just better than anything.","startTime":"17:16","endTime":"17:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But not a product.","startTime":"17:21","endTime":"17:22","speaker_name":"speaker

don't think that rage, if there is a globally optimal way of getting people to convert to the product, then people will do that.","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"18:01","speaker_name":"speaker

faster.","startTime":"18:01","endTime":"18:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's very likely that it's not ragebaid because things get saturated very quickly.","startTime":"18:08","endTime":"18:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if everyone is posting ragebait, then it's not even beta

multi active users between OpenAI and Anthropic, it's clear that one person is winning.","startTime":"20:52","endTime":"20:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I don't think GPT5 is gargantuanly better than any of the clock models.","startTime":"20:58","endTime":"21:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But Anthropic also stirs up controversy because

more?","startTime":"21:12","endTime":"21:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, yeah, I think almost all contracts content is also the reason why people will have like a Superpower launch video and just flop like bro, look, what is the next video?","startTime":"21:13","endTime":"21:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And people just won't have

yourself.","startTime":"22:05","endTime":"22:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if the actual core playbook is differentiated yourself with content, then, yes, Donald

3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What about the differences between the platforms?","startTime":"22:13","endTime":"22:15","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, Twitter is different from Instagram and TikTok.","startTime":"22:15","endTime":"22:18","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, do you have to be, like, more enraging on certain platforms than others?","startTime":"22:18","endTime":"22:21","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'll say there's, like, a few core learnings.","startTime":"22:21","endTime":"22:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this might be, like, the most valuable thing I say on here because I should have, like, a reason to speak on this.","startTime":"22:23","endTime":"22:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But Twitter generally is, like, super caption focused, and it's not video focused almost at all.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You have your scroll time on Twitter is way faster than it's going to be on Instagram.","startTime":"22:35","endTime":"22:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it matters so much what your caption is in techfare specifically, like, people really care that you're announcing, even if you're not announcing shit, which is, like, act like you're announcing something revolutionary because there's a lot of, like, high people, like, fake high people.","startTime":"22:38","endTime":"22:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Jeffs on Twitter will be like, yo, this is interesting.","startTime":"22:50","endTime":"22:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I know all about this.","startTime":"22:53","endTime":"22:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So focus on captioning.","startTime":"22:54","endTime":"22:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Focus on the first frame.","startTime":"22:55","endTime":"22:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That matters more than anything on Instagram and TikTok.","startTime":"22:56","endTime":"22:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The attention span, the time curse roll, is like, it's like, slower.","startTime":"22:59","endTime":"23:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have about three seconds to capture someone's attention.","startTime":"23:03","endTime":"23:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And in that, like, the caption does not matter at all.","startTime":"23:06","endTime":"23:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The only thing that matters is, like, how watchable is the actual video.","startTime":"23:09","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'd say on Instagram things should be vertical.","startTime":"23:12","endTime":"23:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Twitter things should be horizontal.","startTime":"23:14","endTime":"23:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And also, as a general rule of thumb, and this is something that I don't see a lot of people talk about, but there's, like, different levels of consciousness that you have on different platforms.","startTime":"23:16","endTime":"23:24","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"On Instagram TikTok, you have a very low level of consciousness because it doesn't take that much to just sit down and watch a video.","startTime":"23:24","endTime":"23:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And as a result, that's why things like mobile ads like the fucking flapping bird ads, like those will do so well.","startTime":"23:30","endTime":"23:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're operating at like, probably the lowest level of consciousness and it's just so easy for you to be like, emotionally ticked by something and then click it on Twitter because it's casual, focused and you have to actually read the thing.","startTime":"23:36","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're operating at a much higher level.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not as high as you feel like reading a book, but on Twitter, this is the reason why if you're building something like B2B or if you have an actual value and then like, the onboarding takes a lot longer and it's like a desktop app or it's a hardware device, like, you're much better off just solely focusing on Twitter.","startTime":"23:47","endTime":"24:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is true for any content space that is like, the market will be like, catching.","startTime":"24:02","endTime":"24:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's true for Reddit, it's true for LinkedIn.","startTime":"24:07","endTime":"24:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'd say there's different businesses that have no space.","startTime":"24:10","endTime":"24:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like many businesses have absolutely no business being on Instagram TikTok.","startTime":"24:12","endTime":"24:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just because the average consciousness level of people there is going to be too low for anyone to actually.","startTime":"24:16","endTime":"24:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, Sophie, you have to, like, be more enraging.","startTime":"24:22","endTime":"24:25","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So why don't those companies just, like, take the page of the Kuuly Playbook and like, you know, like, be more enraging on them?","startTime":"24:25","endTime":"24:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, this doesn't work for them.","startTime":"24:30","endTime":"24:32","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I wouldn't, like, again, I wouldn't say that enraging is the playbook.","startTime":"24:33","endTime":"24:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like differentiated is the playbook.","startTime":"24:36","endTime":"24:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"24:38","endTime":"24:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For example, when I said, like, introducing the marketing team, like that, that was the fifth video that was just differentiated.","startTime":"24:39","endTime":"24:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"24:44","endTime":"24:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it wasn't raging at all.","startTime":"24:45","endTime":"24:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"24:46","endTime":"24:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I, Yeah, like, I, I think if you can make differentiated content, I'm sure, like anthropic, something like coffee.","startTime":"24:47","endTime":"24:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it was like a different thing why it went viral.","startTime":"24:54","endTime":"24:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And people don't necessarily want to see something enraging.","startTime":"24:57","endTime":"25:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the.","startTime":"25:01","endTime":"25:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, oh.","startTime":"25:03","endTime":"25:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, obviously with the platform, like the reason you are so incentivized to make something eng, it's because on Twitter, the golden thing that you should care about solely is quote posts.","startTime":"25:03","endTime":"25:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you look.","startTime":"25:13","endTime":"25:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is something that is true.","startTime":"25:14","endTime":"25:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I've reviewed a bunch of launch videos from a bunch of founders, and every single time I see a bad one, I will ask them.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When someone Quote posts this, what do you think they will say?","startTime":"25:21","endTime":"25:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it could be like you're launching GPT5 and it's extremely obvious what they'll say.","startTime":"25:23","endTime":"25:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, everyone jumped jump in with their take.","startTime":"25:27","endTime":"25:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you even like, like you just have to imagine that it is very clear, clear in your head when you co post it, someone will say something about it.","startTime":"25:29","endTime":"25:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which is why you want to be like enraging because then like, like they maybe your opinions are the loudest but also like you can do this in many ways.","startTime":"25:37","endTime":"25:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"25:44","endTime":"25:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, so we've kind of gone through a lot of the playbook here but I want to hear what's next for ply?","startTime":"25:44","endTime":"25:52","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"How does Pluli win?","startTime":"25:52","endTime":"25:53","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"How does PLY win?","startTime":"25:55","endTime":"25:57","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean right now I, I generally have this long term vision.","startTime":"25:57","endTime":"26:00","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think like do not take me out of my work list, I'm just a rent kid.","startTime":"26:00","endTime":"26:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But, but I'm pretty sure you have to hedge against both the world of ASI coming relatively soon and also the world that models just plateau here.","startTime":"26:05","endTime":"26:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if models just plateau here, I'm of the opinion that among the consumer AI fuel space there's not been very many that are super interesting and super value add.","startTime":"26:13","endTime":"26:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And of the ones that are like, I'd say like probably the AI note taker is like one of the only ones that I've genuinely seen people gain value out of.","startTime":"26:23","endTime":"26:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So in the case of the models plateau, it feels to me that one of the most compelling things is like the AI note taker.","startTime":"26:30","endTime":"26:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you want to be in that space.","startTime":"26:36","endTime":"26:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We also have to imagine what if our models get like fucking ridiculously good.","startTime":"26:37","endTime":"26:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if that's the case, then the Clue launch video was exactly Suggestive of if GPT7 happened, this is what we think that it would be able to do for your life.","startTime":"26:40","endTime":"26:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And clue in its current form factor, translucent glass pane that appears over everything and augments the way you work on your computer.","startTime":"26:50","endTime":"26:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is prime to enter that space as well.","startTime":"26:57","endTime":"26:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think the way glue wins, I mean at our core we're like an application layer product.","startTime":"27:00","endTime":"27:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it depends on how well the models do.","startTime":"27:05","endTime":"27:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If the models plateau here, then our plan is to become the best AI note taker starting with the consumer and the models get ridiculously better than you saw video yourself.","startTime":"27:07","endTime":"27:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that Cluly in some ways become infamous for this strategy.","startTime":"27:18","endTime":"27:23","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think that a lot of people look at it and say this is not what tech startups should be about.","startTime":"27:24","endTime":"27:28","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You should be focused on building the product.","startTime":"27:28","endTime":"27:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You shouldn't be focusing on just the marketing of it.","startTime":"27:30","endTime":"27:33","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm curious what you say to those people.","startTime":"27:34","endTime":"27:35","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is it critics?","startTime":"27:35","endTime":"27:36","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think for every single successful person, there's like a graveyard of other startups who have failed and wouldn't share the opinion that, oh, you can just fucking build a thing and people will come and there's just so many people out.","startTime":"27:36","endTime":"27:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And usually the only advice you hear is from people who, like Sam Altman will say it's a lot easier to raise $100 million than a million dollars.","startTime":"27:48","endTime":"27:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, yeah, if you're Sam Altman maybe.","startTime":"27:55","endTime":"27:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But realistically, most people, if you're a college student, you won't think that way.","startTime":"27:56","endTime":"28:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And these successful people I think will say what has worked for them is we didn't really focus on marketing because I was a nerdy engineer and I didn't really know how to be it and I didn't need it.","startTime":"28:01","endTime":"28:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you don't need it either.","startTime":"28:12","endTime":"28:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But in reality, like in their wake, there's 100 other failed startups who, if they had adopted this sort of marketing, like, they actually would have it.","startTime":"28:13","endTime":"28:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you just don't hear about them because they're not the ones that get clipped up and they're not the ones that are famous.","startTime":"28:20","endTime":"28:24","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I would say if you actually look at the net opinions of every single person and I truly ignore the noise of every single founder who tried, had a chance and failed.","startTime":"28:24","endTime":"28:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I, I, I, I think a lot of them say like, yeah, Loki, I wish we in their market.","startTime":"28:34","endTime":"28:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you wouldn't hear the successful billionaires.","startTime":"28:38","endTime":"28:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You were just focused on product like I
