1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Awesome.","startTime":"00:10","endTime":"00:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we had a similar panel last year at Disrupt on seed funding and I remember that they were talking about going into 2025.","startTime":"00:11","endTime":"00:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The most important milestone or metric that VCs would be looking for was not necessarily the startup with the highest annual recurring revenue, but rather the quality of revenue.","startTime":"00:18","endTime":"00:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So meaning how are they able to retain customers?","startTime":"00:29","endTime":"00:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Are they increasing their spend?","startTime":"00:32","endTime":"00:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Are they referring others?","startTime":"00:33","endTime":"00:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I'd love to start by asking you both at the tail end of 2025, how are you evaluating the quality of revenue at the seed stage and how has it changed since last year?","startTime":"00:35","endTime":"00:44","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, go for it.","startTime":"00:45","endTime":"00:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh yeah, I think that's still pretty apt.","startTime":"00:47","endTime":"00:50","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think the end of 25 is we're going into, I think we're really going to see, you know, do companies actually have product market fit?","startTime":"00:50","endTime":"00:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, today companies can scale revenue from 1 to 5 million incredibly quickly.","startTime":"00:58","endTime":"01:04","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And now as we go into the next year, it's going to be can you actually retain this customer?","startTime":"01:04","endTime":"01:07","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I think some of that is still true, but I think it's also going to be okay.","startTime":"01:07","endTime":"01:11","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Of these companies that have come into the market who are serving enterprise, they've got that wedge product that they've been able to add product to and go into their Act 2, Act 3 and expand their contracts.","startTime":"01:11","endTime":"01:21","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So it's not just the top line number but it's how have you evolved that top line number over time?","startTime":"01:22","endTime":"01:26","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I would argue that question is actually more apt today than it was a year ago because there's this whole contracted ARR vs real live ARR and people are raising on different numbers and VCs have a lot of opinions on it.","startTime":"01:26","endTime":"01:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think as long as you can talk to both of them.","startTime":"01:39","endTime":"01:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But there is a real question about that conversion.","startTime":"01:41","endTime":"01:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What is the retention?","startTime":"01:43","endTime":"01:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so net dollar retention is very important in this land and expand story is.","startTime":"01:44","endTime":"01:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I also will probably say something a little controversial for early stage pre seed and seed.","startTime":"01:48","endTime":"01:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Unless you're like stripper quote growth.","startTime":"01:53","endTime":"01:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"01:55","endTime":"01:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which is what we're calling these things that just go like to the moon.","startTime":"01:55","endTime":"01:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think revenue is not as important at the early stage.","startTime":"01:58","endTime":"02:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's kind of a false friend.","startTime":"02:01","endTime":"02:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you can't get a couple customers, hire a couple people.","startTime":"02:03","endTime":"02:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's not the hard part.","startTime":"02:06","endTime":"02:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The hard part is after that.","startTime":"02:07","endTime":"02:08","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I tend to focus much more on the idea and the market and the founder.","startTime":"02:08","endTime":"02:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I don't care as much about the Revenue, I would think A is really where revenue comes into play.","startTime":"02:12","endTime":"02:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's much more about the inflection point than it is necessarily.","startTime":"02:16","endTime":"02:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, what is the number?","startTime":"02:20","endTime":"02:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Absolutely.","startTime":"02:21","endTime":"02:22","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so, I mean, expectations have gotten higher in the last year in general.","startTime":"02:22","endTime":"02:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what are you expecting to see for a seed round?","startTime":"02:25","endTime":"02:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think we're expecting to see more than we did in 2024, especially into 2026.","startTime":"02:29","endTime":"02:35","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think companies can get traction that much faster.","startTime":"02:35","endTime":"02:39","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"02:39","endTime":"02:39","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It is that much easier to put together an mvp.","startTime":"02:39","endTime":"02:41","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It is that much easier to get to market.","startTime":"02:41","endTime":"02:42","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I think what we're really looking at is the momentum of that.","startTime":"02:43","endTime":"02:46","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, what does it look like to go from one set of users, 50 users to 100 over time?","startTime":"02:46","endTime":"02:51","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then what does that acceleration of momentum start to look like?","startTime":"02:52","endTime":"02:54","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think I totally agree with Maria on that.","startTime":"02:54","endTime":"02:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's a momentum story very much at seed as well as then I think talent, you know, particularly AI companies, we're in this war for talent.","startTime":"02:57","endTime":"03:04","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And we really look at what is the quality of the team that a founder is able to bring on, how are they recruiting great talent, great engineers to come in and help propel product in a world where it is the team that's going to help the company, you know, through any pivot that they might have to have.","startTime":"03:04","endTime":"03:20","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"03:20","endTime":"03:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I feel like that has held true for a while now, right at this early stage.","startTime":"03:20","endTime":"03:24","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But do you have any predictions for what, 2026, what might change?","startTime":"03:24","endTime":"03:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, I think seed is still bifurcated, so I actually think this trend will continue in 2026, where especially if you're like a really high pedigree team or a serial founder, you can do a seed very easily.","startTime":"03:28","endTime":"03:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Pretty large seed with zero revenue.","startTime":"03:38","endTime":"03:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just idea that's happening left, right and center.","startTime":"03:39","endTime":"03:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I actually think it might be easier to raise a large seed without revenue because worth revenue, unless it's crazy.","startTime":"03:42","endTime":"03:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So do that before you get revenue.","startTime":"03:48","endTime":"03:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I think the A you obviously need a revenue story for, but I think we're still.","startTime":"03:51","endTime":"03:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't really see it slowing down in terms of pricing.","startTime":"03:56","endTime":"03:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There might be an AI wreckage, like kind of dip at some point, which would change it.","startTime":"03:59","endTime":"04:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think there's enough good talent pouring in and I think the thing that people are not talking about enough in the market is that overall round dilution is down for the companies that are the fastest growing.","startTime":"04:03","endTime":"04:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you have to be in earlier.","startTime":"04:14","endTime":"04:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So, like, even if it seems irrational, that's why mega funds are coming earlier and paying up, because it's too costly to miss that round.","startTime":"04:16","endTime":"04:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I don't think we're seeing prices go down anytime soon.","startTime":"04:24","endTime":"04:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How do we feel about that?","startTime":"04:28","endTime":"04:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's pretty tough.","startTime":"04:29","endTime":"04:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think as an investor.","startTime":"04:31","endTime":"04:32","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"04:32","endTime":"04:32","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We always want to come in earlier, get more ownership.","startTime":"04:32","endTime":"04:35","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But I do think to the point, right.","startTime":"04:36","endTime":"04:37","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"In a world where it is, you know, 0.3% of companies are the ones that are really driving the market.","startTime":"04:37","endTime":"04:42","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's like the power law of power laws today, you know, you do what you need to do to get into the best rounds and work with the best founders.","startTime":"04:42","endTime":"04:50","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think at seed, what is really important is the quality of the founder and quality of the people that they're bringing on.","startTime":"04:50","endTime":"04:55","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so if you find someone who's able to, you know, with the great team, an incredible vision product, you know, you don't want to overpay, but you do, it makes sense within your model for your fund structure.","startTime":"04:55","endTime":"05:05","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"05:06","endTime":"05:06","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so let's talk a little bit about what we expect of these founders.","startTime":"05:06","endTime":"05:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"05:09","endTime":"05:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So Maria, when we chatted the other day, you mentioned that you look for founders who are fluent in vc.","startTime":"05:09","endTime":"05:15","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I absolutely love.","startTime":"05:15","endTime":"05:16","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I would also like to unpack a little bit more what you mean by that and what sort of signals to you that a founder knows how to play this game.","startTime":"05:16","endTime":"05:22","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, well, I actually don't.","startTime":"05:23","endTime":"05:24","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I more help them become fluid.","startTime":"05:24","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think.","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't care if when they meet me, they are.","startTime":"05:26","endTime":"05:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I spend a lot more time on people.","startTime":"05:27","endTime":"05:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what I mean by that, to make it like tactically real, is I almost never have a founder pitch me the deck in the first meeting.","startTime":"05:29","endTime":"05:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"95% of my first meeting time is on them as a person and 5% is on the business.","startTime":"05:36","endTime":"05:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I will do a lot of work on the business, A, if we go forward together and B, on my own time.","startTime":"05:41","endTime":"05:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I feel like I try to spend my time with them on stuff that I can't get in my from the deck, from my own knowledge.","startTime":"05:46","endTime":"05:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it just feels different.","startTime":"05:52","endTime":"05:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like being a founder right now, it's like Groundhog day out there.","startTime":"05:52","endTime":"05:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, you especially if you take the mega funds, which are great, and we all want them to mark up our deals and blah, blah.","startTime":"05:55","endTime":"06:00","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But like, you know, you.","startTime":"06:00","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You pitch a company a deck, you pitch a principal or a small partner, P, then you pitch another partner, then you pitch a third partner, then you pitch two partners.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Maybe they're IC by the time you're done with one fund, you've basically given the same deck like 10 times.","startTime":"06:09","endTime":"06:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like, let's be realistic.","startTime":"06:14","endTime":"06:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Most questions are not unbelievably great.","startTime":"06:15","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so everyone's stopping you at the same obvious question point, like, but didn't that competitor raise more than you?","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:22","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Blah, blah.","startTime":"06:22","endTime":"06:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you tax that by 20 funds.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like a very Groundhog Day experience.","startTime":"06:25","endTime":"06:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think anything you could do to like feel different and be a little bit more human is valuable.","startTime":"06:27","endTime":"06:31","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's just how I assess things.","startTime":"06:31","endTime":"06:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I do think about this as a language where like the best VCs are always fluent in VC and the best founders, I think over time get close to fluent and probably start out conversational or where's the bathroom?","startTime":"06:33","endTime":"06:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not even.","startTime":"06:43","endTime":"06:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the funny part is I think you get really judged by whether or not you speak the language by the rest of the industry.","startTime":"06:44","endTime":"06:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you have to like go do friendly pitches with other founders and other VCs so that you know not to do simple stuff.","startTime":"06:49","endTime":"06:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like as an example, you should never show a five year revenue projection that's less than $100 million.","startTime":"06:54","endTime":"07:00","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, don't be realistic.","startTime":"07:00","endTime":"07:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No one's rewarding you for that.","startTime":"07:01","endTime":"07:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No one's going to hold you that number.","startTime":"07:02","endTime":"07:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if you put less than that and it's perceived as like an ambition gap and the truth is, like the person before or after you that's going in and showing a crazy number is just as unlikely to have that number as everyone is.","startTime":"07:04","endTime":"07:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that kind of stuff.","startTime":"07:15","endTime":"07:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or like a small thing like putting in the valuation you want in your last slide.","startTime":"07:16","endTime":"07:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Don't put that in.","startTime":"07:20","endTime":"07:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every VC will know you've never fundraised if you put that in.","startTime":"07:21","endTime":"07:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like just kind of learn the language will help you fundraise a lot.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, but I would love to know what you do with founders on that first meeting.","startTime":"07:27","endTime":"07:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you do things, I mean, other than sitting in an office?","startTime":"07:32","endTime":"07:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Are we taking them to play handball?","startTime":"07:34","endTime":"07:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Pickleball?","startTime":"07:36","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What are we doing?","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:37","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, we really go into their background.","startTime":"07:38","endTime":"07:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, like really, like, where did you grow up?","startTime":"07:40","endTime":"07:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Why did you make the life choices you did?","startTime":"07:43","endTime":"07:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Whatever is meaningful to you.","startTime":"07:45","endTime":"07:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It might be a story about a relative or sibling or something happening in college.","startTime":"07:46","endTime":"07:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I, and if we spend more time together, I give them my story.","startTime":"07:51","endTime":"07:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We go even deeper than that.","startTime":"07:54","endTime":"07:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like 90 minutes in, another call.","startTime":"07:55","endTime":"07:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I just really want to get to know them and their motivations and why they care about building what they're building much more than what I can get in the deck, which I'll get anyway.","startTime":"07:57","endTime":"08:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Agreed.","startTime":"08:05","endTime":"08:06","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"One of the favorite questions we have in our partner meeting, one ones with Founders is what's something competitive that you used to do growing up?","startTime":"08:06","endTime":"08:12","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because we think that can share a lot about the founder, what they've tried to do, where they failed, their level of ambition, to your point.","startTime":"08:13","endTime":"08:19","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so yeah, getting back to the story about who someone is, why this is the thing that they are uniquely suited to be building and why now is the opportunity point is something that we really focus on too.","startTime":"08:20","endTime":"08:29","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that's such a great point because the reason I threw Pickleball out is because I've heard wild stories about VCs taking founders into really sort of challenging like experiences to push their limits and see how they react when they're under pressure, when they're a little bit stressed.","startTime":"08:29","endTime":"08:41","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Have you ever done anything like that?","startTime":"08:41","endTime":"08:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not in diligence.","startTime":"08:43","endTime":"08:44","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We spend a lot of time trying to get to know founders earlier in the process.","startTime":"08:45","endTime":"08:48","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So, you know, getting to understand who they are, you know, longer than that three week period where they're pitching.","startTime":"08:48","endTime":"08:53","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so we've done Pickleball, we've done Padel and a number of other things too.","startTime":"08:53","endTime":"08:56","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"08:56","endTime":"08:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, it seems like these days there's sort of an archetype, a founder that's getting funded because of this competitive landscape.","startTime":"08:57","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And honestly, it's often the safer bet, right?","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's the second time founder, it's the industry insider, fluent in VC speak, you know the type.","startTime":"09:05","endTime":"09:10","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I guess I'm wondering if you can tell us about a founder that you backed that maybe didn't fit that mold and what they did to win you over.","startTime":"09:10","endTime":"09:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I actually think it's going the other way now.","startTime":"09:18","endTime":"09:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think there are a lot of serial founders getting backed, but because of the success of Mercour and

literally.","startTime":"09:27","endTime":"09:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And some people are that and some people are not that.","startTime":"09:30","endTime":"09:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think that we've over rotated probably a little bit as an industry, but I do back 20 year olds and I do back serial sign founders all over the board.","startTime":"09:33","endTime":"09:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But someone unique that I backed recently who is 20, he has been building companies since he was 14.","startTime":"09:41","endTime":"09:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think for me, I don't look for the same thing in everyone's background because especially also if you take a diversity lens, you can't expect it to show up the same way for different people.","startTime":"09:48","endTime":"09:57","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So maybe for one person it's a competitive lens, maybe for one person it's not.","startTime":"09:57","endTime":"10:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But they just really love the robotics field and they're building and that it's kind of like why they should be building this.","startTime":"10:01","endTime":"10:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But this particular founder is Serbian, has been building companies since he was 14 in Germany.","startTime":"10:07","endTime":"10:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like, if he was building companies since he was 14 in SF, it's still impressive, but, like, not as impressive because it's very encouraging ecosystem to do that here.","startTime":"10:14","endTime":"10:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And your parents probably encourage you, they probably help you do it.","startTime":"10:21","endTime":"10:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that is not true in Germany.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so, like, it's just like, he's kind of always done this and been against the grain in his own way and had conviction in what he's done.","startTime":"10:26","endTime":"10:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And one thing that I kind of look for, even though you can't really boil down to traits, is people who follow their own, like, listen to their own gut.","startTime":"10:32","endTime":"10:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, one of the hardest things to do right as a founder, but one of the most important things is to know when to listen to other people and say, you know what?","startTime":"10:39","endTime":"10:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Everyone from my board to other founders is saying this, maybe I should change my mind on that.","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"10:49","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And when to say, nope, that's complete BS And I'm sticking with this.","startTime":"10:49","endTime":"10:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, that is hard to get.","startTime":"10:52","endTime":"10:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:54","endTime":"10:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One I think about a lot is the pace of learning and the rate of learning that a founder has.","startTime":"10:55","endTime":"10:59","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so one that I backed, you know, very young founder, what didn't work in the insurance industry, but learned very quickly, the ins and outs of it to solve a very specific problem for insurers and for homeowners.","startTime":"10:59","endTime":"11:12","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think for that particular founder, I just looked for patterns of how they've been able to access and get into different spaces where normally they might not have been able to, but by virtue of their own pace of learning, by the virtue of their own ability to tell a great story about themselves, about the problem, they're able to get into rooms that they otherwise wouldn't.","startTime":"11:13","endTime":"11:31","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think whether you're scaling your team, whether you're hiring, whether you're pitching investors, I think having that level of scrappiness, of hustle, but also an ability to navigate spaces that are unfamiliar is incredibly important.","startTime":"11:31","endTime":"11:43","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's interesting because I feel like some of these things are

when it might feel irrelevant if it wasn't direct industry experience?","startTime":"11:48","endTime":"11:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or Was it my PhD in X topic?","startTime":"11:56","endTime":"11:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I'm going to now tell you that I am

for?","startTime":"12:01","endTime":"12:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think in those first meetings, it really is trying to connect with an investor and trying to articulate and find those points of opportunity to share those.","startTime":"12:04","endTime":"12:12","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think if you go back to the product and the business, maybe it's even talking a little bit about how you got your first customer or how you build your MVP or.","startTime":"12:12","endTime":"12:19","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"One of the things I lean to is customer relationship research.","startTime":"12:19","endTime":"12:21","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Does a founder know their customer better than anybody else?","startTime":"12:21","endTime":"12:24","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And getting those insights and what that earned secret is goes a really long way, I think, in showing and showcasing how a founder is able to navigate some of those challenges, but show some of that grit, some of that resourcefulness.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:35","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Some of that hustle on that point.","startTime":"12:35","endTime":"12:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's basically like there's a difference between saying, I went and talked to 20 people that I

learned.","startTime":"12:41","endTime":"12:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"12:42","endTime":"12:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a different level of depth that you went into.","startTime":"12:42","endTime":"12:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think it's partially our job to bring it out in the founder meeting.","startTime":"12:45","endTime":"12:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But also I would recommend any founder and just like, really overly spend time more than even on your deck on that first two minutes when you introduce yourself.","startTime":"12:48","endTime":"12:56","speaker_name":"speaker

first two minutes are unbelievably important.","startTime":"13:06","endTime":"13:08","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I shouldn't say this, but one of my companies is raising right now, and they have really good metrics, but they joke that it's.","startTime":"13:09","endTime":"13:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They put the slide of metrics first and it was like the pay the fuck attention slide.","startTime":"13:18","endTime":"13:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sorry, I don't know if we're not supposed to be sorry on stage, but I think you actually want that feeling at the beginning of every meeting.","startTime":"13:21","endTime":"13:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you can get that lots of ways even if you don't have metrics.","startTime":"13:25","endTime":"13:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I will always remember in Covid that this one founder, I didn't end up investing in her business, but she started the meeting by just like, asking me questions.","startTime":"13:28","endTime":"13:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, she was like, hey, I'm doing this thing for Biz Devil.","startTime":"13:36","endTime":"13:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, have you ever had to close a deal with anyone?","startTime":"13:38","endTime":"13:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what did it look like?","startTime":"13:40","endTime":"13:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, like, maybe that wouldn't have worked for anyone, but people sometimes get like 15 pitches a day, and anything you can do to just, like, feel a little different and stand out at the beginning, I think will just make the whole meeting more productive.","startTime":"13:41","endTime":"13:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"13:52","endTime":"13:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But let's dig into that a bit.","startTime":"13:53","endTime":"13:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, I mean, I think sometimes people forget that VC is a business too.","startTime":"13:54","endTime":"13:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You guys have to make returns for your LPs.","startTime":"13:57","endTime":"13:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You have your own career goals, you have things you want to

second.","startTime":"14:02","endTime":"14:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what is happening on your side of the table?","startTime":"14:04","endTime":"14:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Before, during and after one of these founder meetings?","startTime":"14:06","endTime":"14:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Who are the stakeholders to sort of walk us through the that journey?","startTime":"14:09","endTime":"14:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"14:11","endTime":"14:12","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So a founder comes in, it's probably a 30 minute meeting call in person.","startTime":"14:12","endTime":"14:16","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They're walking through their story, their background, their pitch, what they're building.","startTime":"14:16","endTime":"14:19","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But internally, the things I'm thinking about are, okay, I know this category, maybe I don't.","startTime":"14:20","endTime":"14:24","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What are the questions my team will have?","startTime":"14:24","endTime":"14:26","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What are the other deals that we're really evaluating right now?","startTime":"14:26","endTime":"14:29","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And how does this stack up against that?","startTime":"14:29","endTime":"14:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"How does this founder stack up against some of the others that I'm meeting that I've known for a long time?","startTime":"14:30","endTime":"14:35","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think one of the hardest things as a VC is that we just say no a lot of.","startTime":"14:35","endTime":"14:38","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But it's not because always it's about the founder, it's about the product or the business.","startTime":"14:38","endTime":"14:42","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There's a question of opportunity cost because we really are looking for that one in a thousand, almost even now, one in ten thousand type of company founder business.","startTime":"14:42","endTime":"14:50","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so I think kind of, to Maria's point, one of the things to think about in your pitch is how do I make sure that the VC knows that I am the opportunity, I am the founder they should be paying attention to when we've got six, eight, ten meetings in a week and we're pitching that back to our partnership team.","startTime":"14:50","endTime":"15:05","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think I'll take it from a year perspective because I think it is kind of hard.","startTime":"15:06","endTime":"15:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's way harder to be a founder than a vc, to be clear.","startTime":"15:09","endTime":"15:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think the parts of being a VC that are hard are maybe not as obvious.","startTime":"15:12","endTime":"15:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think it's actually not that hard to be an okay vc.","startTime":"15:16","endTime":"15:18","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's really hard to be an incredibly great vc.","startTime":"15:18","endTime":"15:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think being an OK VC is probably not that hard.","startTime":"15:20","endTime":"15:22","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean truthfully.","startTime":"15:23","endTime":"15:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I would say I typically meet about 500 people a year, 500 founders, new founders a year.","startTime":"15:25","endTime":"15:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm probably investing in three to four of those companies.","startTime":"15:33","endTime":"15:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that means 496 other meetings, I'm saying no and basically telling the founder that their baby's ugly in a way that they hopefully don't feel offended and keep sending me more deals.","startTime":"15:36","endTime":"15:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"15:47","endTime":"15:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it does those 496 absolutely make my reputation.","startTime":"15:48","endTime":"15:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"15:52","endTime":"15:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You make, you make your money on the deals that succeed.","startTime":"15:52","endTime":"15:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You make your reputation on every interaction and so, like, I think that.","startTime":"15:55","endTime":"15:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then aside from the deal side, which is that side, you're helping those companies.","startTime":"15:59","endTime":"16:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the three or four I invest in a year, I have four of those every new year, so.","startTime":"16:02","endTime":"16:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I work with them for 10 to 15 years.","startTime":"16:06","endTime":"16:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm really going to battle for those companies a lot of my week as well.","startTime":"16:07","endTime":"16:11","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then working with the partnership, looking at other people's deals, all that stuff, the thing I would say is to remember, I think it's really important.","startTime":"16:11","endTime":"16:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I kind of feel like we've seen should, like, take an oath the same way doctors take notes sometimes.","startTime":"16:17","endTime":"16:22","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I just think sometimes it's hard.","startTime":"16:22","endTime":"16:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"When you look at a lot of businesses, it starts to feel like there's a lot of businesses.","startTime":"16:23","endTime":"16:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's just really important to remember that for each of these founders, this is their baby, this is their life.","startTime":"16:26","endTime":"16:31","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you owe the respect to them to have read the deck ahead of time, show up on time.","startTime":"16:31","endTime":"16:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the best thing to a yes is a really fast and really honest no when I say no, unless there's something really that I can't say to them.","startTime":"16:35","endTime":"16:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, my friend pinged me and said, this person committed fraud in their last company, and I can't tell you that.","startTime":"16:43","endTime":"16:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Only in that scenario would I not tell them.","startTime":"16:48","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I just am really honest about why I pass.","startTime":"16:50","endTime":"16:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because the reality is, if I'm passing for a certain reason on the market or whatever, probably somebody else thinks that and then they can figure out how they position that or if they agree or disagree.","startTime":"16:52","endTime":"17:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I often say, like, I mean, I hate BC passing mails.","startTime":"17:01","endTime":"17:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're like the worst garbage.","startTime":"17:04","endTime":"17:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But, like, you know, I cheer for me from the sidelines, blah, blah.","startTime":"17:05","endTime":"17:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, it's awful.","startTime":"17:09","endTime":"17:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the truth is, I do often say, like, just because I'm passing doesn't make me right.","startTime":"17:10","endTime":"17:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I am probably wrong.","startTime":"17:16","endTime":"17:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it does make me the wrong investor for you.","startTime":"17:17","endTime":"17:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because you want someone, especially the precedent seat, who is, like, irrationally excited as you are about this vision.","startTime":"17:19","endTime":"17:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think it's a lot about Match, sometimes not even about.","startTime":"17:26","endTime":"17:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not even about, like, my process.","startTime":"17:31","endTime":"17:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I would just double click on that for this audience who I think a lot of them are founders.","startTime":"17:33","endTime":"17:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a lot of VCs out there.","startTime":"17:37","endTime":"17:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not just Sequoia and Excel andreessen.","startTime":"17:39","endTime":"17:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, like, I think one of the biggest mistakes people do in fundraising is they go talk to, like, the top 10 logos.","startTime":"17:41","endTime":"17:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's literally thousands, basically go out and talk to 30 in the first two weeks because you're more likely to get some interested parties.","startTime":"17:47","endTime":"17:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the more you get to your people, you will feel it when you are talking to someone who wants to back your business.","startTime":"17:54","endTime":"17:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It will feel like a very different conversation immediately.","startTime":"17:59","endTime":"18:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'd agree with that.","startTime":"18:02","endTime":"18:03","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think the other thing, at least from an inside baseball perspective, is the VCs excited about your business.","startTime":"18:03","endTime":"18:08","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They're going to move very quickly.","startTime":"18:08","endTime":"18:09","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They want to be first, they want to be the right partner for you.","startTime":"18:09","endTime":"18:12","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so always think about that as a signaling effect.","startTime":"18:12","endTime":"18:15","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I encourage founders actually just to ask, you know, directly, where are you?","startTime":"18:15","endTime":"18:19","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Where are we in your process?","startTime":"18:19","endTime":"18:20","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"How quickly do you typically move?","startTime":"18:20","endTime":"18:21","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because that also then gives you a sense of if it's going to be the right VC for you very quickly.","startTime":"18:21","endTime":"18:25","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Absolutely.","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm loving the inside perspective.","startTime":"18:27","endTime":"18:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think VC is often sort of a black box to founders.","startTime":"18:29","endTime":"18:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"18:31","endTime":"18:32","speaker_name":"speaker

question.","startTime":"18:43","endTime":"18:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I do think founders would benefit from knowing more about vc.","startTime":"18:44","endTime":"18:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I think sometimes they think the money we invest grows on trees.","startTime":"18:47","endTime":"18:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you find that tree anywhere, you tell me where it is.","startTime":"18:50","endTime":"18:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But truthfully, it doesn't.","startTime":"18:52","endTime":"18:53","speaker_name":"speaker

it's the power law, like outsized returns.","startTime":"19:06","endTime":"19:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think it's also important to understand, like how big you think your business can be and what fund size matches that and learn a little bit more about how VCs make money, even like where they are in their fund cycle.","startTime":"19:14","endTime":"19:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"How many partners do they have?","startTime":"19:23","endTime":"19:25","speaker_name":"speaker

think understanding and asking the VC a little bit more than just their process, like where are they by the way?","startTime":"19:32","endTime":"19:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's a really good way to stand out.","startTime":"19:39","endTime":"19:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every VC asks the process at the

differently.","startTime":"19:43","endTime":"19:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think the other piece around like where they are in the fund cycle is understand what other founders think of this vc and you don't have to have connections.","startTime":"19:48","endTime":"19:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, let's say you get a term

founders.","startTime":"20:25","endTime":"20:28","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, one of the smarter questions I think people ask is, okay, give me a founder that has done really well and then give me a founder that hasn't done very well.","startTime":"20:28","endTime":"20:34","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because I think to Maria's point,

become.","startTime":"20:34","endTime":"20:44","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you always want to make sure you've got a VC who will be in your corner and support you through those lower parts of the journey too.","startTime":"20:44","endTime":"20:49","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay, and so let's take it a little bit further.","startTime":"20:50","endTime":"20:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So say you found a VC that aligns with your stage and your sector.","startTime":"20:52","endTime":"20:55","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You align on long term vision, and now you're starting to talk

raise?","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And what's the risk of overshooting the mark and raising too much at a seed

constraints.","startTime":"21:17","endTime":"21:23","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But you also don't want to hamstring yourself and your business by not raising enough

happen.","startTime":"21:23","endTime":"21:34","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think what's really important right now at Seed is really thinking about, okay, what do I need to do to get to the Series A?","startTime":"21:35","endTime":"21:40","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That gap is getting much wider.","startTime":"21:40","endTime":"21:41","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think a few years ago, 1 in 3 companies could successfully raise a series A, say with 1 million

7.","startTime":"21:49","endTime":"21:51","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so that bar for getting to the A is that much higher.","startTime":"21:52","endTime":"21:54","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Costs are also going up in some ways too.","startTime":"21:55","endTime":"21:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I think it's really important to think about, you know, do I have say 24 months of Runway, but is that going to be enough for me to actually see an inflection point in the business to get into a series of milestones?","startTime":"21:57","endTime":"22:07","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think it's tricky because I think everyone knows this, but at pre seed and seed it's not.","startTime":"22:09","endTime":"22:17","speaker_name":"speaker

it.","startTime":"22:40","endTime":"22:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a really good article back in like 2021 about like why raising twice as much at twice a high valuation is not always actually better for you at the early stage.","startTime":"22:43","endTime":"22:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think there is some point that like staying scrappy and like getting really product market fit right and then scaling is valuable.","startTime":"22:52","endTime":"22:57","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the worst thing for your company is a down round.","startTime":"22:58","endTime":"23:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You, you never want to be in a down round.","startTime":"23:01","endTime":"23:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if you raise too high, that can be sometimes what happens.","startTime":"23:02","endTime":"23:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you just want to set your price that you know you can grow into in the next round and then some because you always want to have up rounds obviously for your ownership and everyone else in your company.","startTime":"23:05","endTime":"23:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I do think I would recommend right now in this moment especially because I think everyone feels like there's like an impending doom moment around me, around AI

2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I totally agree, but I would raise a little more than you planned because the series A's are less harder right now.","startTime":"23:22","endTime":"23:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I would raise a little bit more Runway if I could.","startTime":"23:28","endTime":"23:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I probably have three years Runway than two years right now if I can get that done.","startTime":"23:30","endTime":"23:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I would say you're probably going to be raising between one and five for a seed.","startTime":"23:34","endTime":"23:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If it's a really big seed, maybe closer to 8 to 10, but for that 1 to 5, make it last.","startTime":"23:37","endTime":"23:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Make it three years.","startTime":"23:43","endTime":"23:44","speaker_name":"speaker

of my founders like, and I like as well is that it's easier to move a bicycle than a tank.","startTime":"23:47","endTime":"23:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you have less people and like really keep it constrained until you're really able to grow.","startTime":"23:52","endTime":"23:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Otherwise you're going to blow through your money faster than you should.","startTime":"23:57","endTime":"23:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And to the valuation point, I always tell folks to optimize for the partner, not for the number, not for the valuation.","startTime":"23:59","endTime":"24:05","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So just keep that in mind.","startTime":"24:06","endTime":"24:07","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Also when you're, you know, in the final stage of deciding which partners to go.","startTime":"24:07","endTime":"24:11","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And can we say like when you say optimize for the partner, I agree with that.","startTime":"24:11","endTime":"24:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think also a lot of first time founders I see like optimized for something short term, like, oh, they could introduce me to these three customers or they have this advisor.","startTime":"24:14","endTime":"24:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do not optimize for the short term.","startTime":"24:21","endTime":"24:22","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Truth is if you're founding this company, you will get to those people anyway.","startTime":"24:22","endTime":"24:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You will sell that customer anyway, you will hire that person anyway.","startTime":"24:25","endTime":"24:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sure they should and can help you.","startTime":"24:28","endTime":"24:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But way more important to optimize for who's a good long term partner, what did this person show up like in good and bad, did they ignore their companies?","startTime":"24:30","endTime":"24:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like get optimized for the long run because there's super value added VCs, they're super value neutral VCs and there's value destructive VCs.","startTime":"24:37","endTime":"24:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And as long as you avoid the last one, you're golden.","startTime":"24:45","endTime":"24:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, definitely avoid that last one.","startTime":"24:48","endTime":"24:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's great advice.","startTime":"24:49","endTime":"24:50","speaker_name":"speaker

to play a game, a quick game of Red Flag, Green flag.","startTime":"24:58","endTime":"25:02","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'm going to say a common thing that founders do
