## Notes

### **Seed Stage Revenue Quality and Market Expectations**
- Seed-stage revenue quality is now judged more on customer retention and expansion than on raw numbers.
- **VCs emphasized the importance of net dollar retention and “land and expand” strategies** as key indicators of product-market fit and revenue quality at seed stage, beyond just top-line growth (00:30)  
    - Speakers noted companies can scale revenue quickly from **$1 million to $5 million**, but sustaining and growing that revenue through customer retention is the true test.  
    - The focus has shifted toward how companies evolve revenue over time, especially in enterprise markets with multi-phase product adoption.  
    - Founders should demonstrate the ability to expand contracts and deepen customer relationships rather than just initial sales.  
    - This shift responds to investors’ desire for sustainable growth metrics rather than vanity numbers.
- **Momentum in user growth and team quality are now critical evaluation factors at seed** (02:20)  
    - VCs look for fast acceleration, such as moving from **50 to 100 users** and beyond, as evidence of traction.  
    - Recruiting top talent, particularly engineers in AI, is seen as a key driver of success and adaptability in a shifting market.  
    - This talent war underlines the value of team-building skills for founders, which often outweighs early revenue figures.  
    - Predictions for 2026 suggest this bifurcation will continue, with pedigree teams raising large seeds without revenue, while others must prove traction.
- **Market dynamics favor earlier, larger seed rounds with less dilution for fastest-growing startups** (04:15)  
    - Mega funds are entering seed rounds aggressively to secure ownership in high-potential companies, even if they lack revenue.  
    - This trend is driven by the high cost of missing out on breakout startups in a concentrated market where a tiny fraction drive outsized returns.  
    - Investors acknowledge the tension between early entry and valuation discipline but expect prices to remain stable for now.
### **Founder Evaluation and Fundraising Strategy**
- Investor-founder fit and founder fluency in VC dynamics are key to successful fundraising.
- **Founders’ personal stories and motivations take precedence over pitch decks in early meetings** (05:30)  
    - Maria explained that **95% of first meetings focus on the founder’s background and motivations**, not the business details.  
    - This personal insight helps investors assess resilience, ambition, and founder-market fit beyond surface-level metrics.  
    - Founders who can humanize themselves and tell unique stories stand out from repetitive pitch cycles.  
    - Building fluency in VC language is vital; founders must learn fundraising norms like avoiding unrealistic revenue projections and valuation asks.
- **Effective founder narratives include deep customer knowledge and resourcefulness** (12:00)  
    - Founders should showcase how they engaged with customers, ideally talking to **hundreds of prospects**, not just a handful.  
    - Demonstrating intimate customer insights signals grit and understanding, which is often more important than early metrics.  
    - Practicing a concise, compelling two-minute intro helps set a strong tone for meetings.  
    - Founders who differentiate themselves early tend to have more productive investor conversations.
- **VCs manage high volume and high rejection rates with a focus on long-term partnerships** (15:00)  
    - Investors meet about **500 founders annually but invest in only 3 or 4**, highlighting intense selectivity.  
    - They stress delivering honest, respectful feedback quickly to maintain relationships with rejected founders.  
    - Fit matters: investors want to back founders they are “irrationally excited” about who align with their vision.  
    - Founders are advised to meet many VCs early and seek partners who genuinely believe in their mission.
### **Fundraising Amounts and Runway Planning**
- Seed round sizing must balance runway needs with valuation discipline to reach Series A successfully.
- **Raising enough capital to reach meaningful milestones is more important than headline numbers** (21:20)  
    - The **gap between seed and Series A has widened**, with only about **1 in 7 companies raising A rounds today compared to 1 in 3 previously**.  
    - Founders should aim for **24 to 36 months of runway** to hit key inflection points, rather than just maximizing round size.  
    - Overshooting seed raises risks down rounds, which damage ownership and momentum.  
    - Investors recommend raising between **$1 million and $5 million** for seed, with larger seeds up to **$8–10 million** only if justified.
- **Valuation and partner fit should be prioritized over maximizing price** (23:40)  
    - Founders are advised to optimize for the right VC partner’s long-term support rather than short-term perks like introductions or advisors.  
    - Good VCs add significant value over time, while “value-neutral” or “value-destructive” investors can harm growth.  
    - This mindset encourages founders to focus on sustainable relationships, not just immediate capital or buzz.  
    - Smaller, scrappy teams are easier to manage early, akin to moving a bicycle instead of a tank.
### **Diversity and Non-Traditional Founder Profiles**
- Venture capital is expanding beyond traditional founder archetypes, valuing unique backgrounds and learning ability.
- **Funders recognize success in diverse founder backgrounds who show conviction and fast learning** (09:40)  
    - Panelists highlighted backing young founders with unconventional paths, such as a **Serbian founder building startups since age 14 in Germany**, overcoming ecosystem challenges.  
    - Key traits include following one’s own intuition while balancing external advice and demonstrating rapid domain learning.  
    - Founders who can navigate unfamiliar spaces through hustle and storytelling often access opportunities others cannot.  
    - This expands the definition of “founder fit” beyond pedigree or serial experience.
- **Communicating competence without traditional credentials requires storytelling and deep customer insights** (28:00)  
    - For founders with gaps like caregiving or career changes, speakers advised building networks actively through meetups and events.  
    - Demonstrating domain knowledge via self-study and showing passion in areas like security or AI can overcome resume gaps.  
    - The right investors will understand non-linear journeys and value tenacity over formal credentials.  
    - Persistence in outreach and storytelling is critical to breaking into investor networks.
### **Sector and Product Strategy Insights**
- AI native status and sector focus influence investment interest but customer delight remains paramount.
- **Investors back companies that integrate AI meaningfully, even if not AI-native** (30:30)  
    - While many recent investments are AI-native, VCs also fund companies using AI as a component to solve real customer problems.  
    - The key metric is customer satisfaction and product-market fit, not the AI label itself.  
    - Non-AI native companies may face more competition but can succeed by owning distribution and customer relationships.  
    - Investors stress aligning pitches with fund theses and understanding fund strategies to improve chances.
- **Market specialization improves fundraising success in niche sectors like aerospace and space tech** (29:00)  
    - Founders from non-traditional geographies like the Midwest are encouraged to emphasize deep customer knowledge and domain expertise.  
    - Targeting VCs with relevant sector theses (e.g., space-focused funds) increases likelihood of meaningful engagement.  
    - Competitive overlap with dominant players (like SpaceX) can be a hard no for many investors, so positioning matters.  
    - Talent and story remain critical regardless of location.
### **Founder-VC Relationship and Due Diligence**
- Long-term partnership quality and reputation matter as much as funding terms in VC selection.
- **Founders should research VC fund cycles, decision-making power, and reputation before accepting terms** (19:00)  
    - Understanding where a VC is in their fund life and their political influence affects pro rata and follow-on support.  
    - Checking references with other founders, including those with negative experiences, is vital to avoid value-destructive investors.  
    - VCs invest in founders for the long haul, often working together for **10 to 15 years**, so alignment is crucial.  
    - Honest, fast no’s are preferred over vague pass emails to help founders iterate quickly.
- **VCs emphasize the importance of mutual respect and professionalism in fundraising interactions** (16:00)  
    - Reading decks before meetings, punctuality, and respectful communication shape investor perception.  
    - VCs acknowledge the emotional stakes for founders and strive to balance tough rejections with encouragement.  
    - Maintaining a positive relationship even after rejection keeps doors open for future deals or referrals.  
    - This culture of respect ultimately supports a healthier startup ecosystem.
