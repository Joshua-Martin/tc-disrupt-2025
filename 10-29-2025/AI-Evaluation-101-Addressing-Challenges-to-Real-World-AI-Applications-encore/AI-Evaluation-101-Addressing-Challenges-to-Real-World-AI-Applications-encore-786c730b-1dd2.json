1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Hoping we'll have a good conversation.","startTime":"00:26","endTime":"00:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's like maybe a couple of things on my mind and I am curious about, you know, maybe doing some quick post, learning a little bit about what people think about a few things.","startTime":"00:29","endTime":"00:39","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But where maybe we can get started is talk a little bit about what, you know, what kind of AI we're building and what its capabilities are versus what differentiates AI versus human, and then get into how the models think and then talk about evals and how you build evals and make sure that when you're trying to deploy that it actually sort of like does what you think it will do.","startTime":"00:39","endTime":"01:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And hopefully if we have time, we can take one of the use cases that somebody has on deploying them and walk through how we would maybe build an econ for that particular use case.","startTime":"01:08","endTime":"01:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So to get us started, what I did was I wrote down a few questions and maybe that's like where both reflects my curiosity and sort of trying to figure out what people think about these things, but also get us going.","startTime":"01:19","endTime":"01:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the first thing that I'm very curious about is how people think AI.","startTime":"01:33","endTime":"01:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What do people think about the AI capabilities in terms of where it is good at doing things?","startTime":"01:40","endTime":"01:47","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So maybe let's start with a quick pull.","startTime":"01:48","endTime":"01:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So psychologist Daniel Kahneman talks about intelligence in terms of System one and System two thinking.","startTime":"01:54","endTime":"02:00","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"System one is the intuitive thinking and system, which is like sort of very gut feeling, very fast.","startTime":"02:00","endTime":"02:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's reacted in a way.","startTime":"02:11","endTime":"02:12","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And system two is where you are deliberately logically thinking through things.","startTime":"02:13","endTime":"02:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if, let's say were to take people and divide in two camps, one is people who believe that maybe humans are good at system one thinking and maybe AIs not better than humans or anything, but like, let's say maybe AI is good at System two thinking with logical reasons.","startTime":"02:19","endTime":"02:38","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's Camp one or maybe Camp two, where AI is good at system one thinking, computer creative thinking, and humans are maybe better at systems using technological reasoning.","startTime":"02:38","endTime":"02:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And with a quick show of hands, curious.","startTime":"02:52","endTime":"02:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How many people are in Camp one?","startTime":"02:54","endTime":"02:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so a few.","startTime":"02:59","endTime":"03:01","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And how many people are in Canada too?","startTime":"03:02","endTime":"03:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"More.","startTime":"03:06","endTime":"03:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so historically, at least from all the sort of popular culture media that I've been using, it has been that we've come to think of AI as very sort of cold, hard, logical center, not so much as creative.","startTime":"03:06","endTime":"03:22","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's like Data in startup frag or T100 or Sonny in the

1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that has caused us to think that what makes us uniquely human is our creative, intuitive selves, right?","startTime":"03:31","endTime":"03:38","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That is what we identify as what sets us apart.","startTime":"03:38","endTime":"03:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I don't know why, sort of like we sort of come to that place, why we've come to think of ourselves as that, but it certainly reflects heavily the popular culture.","startTime":"03:44","endTime":"03:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it might because historically, like in the past, in the 50s, 60s when the AI systems like Denver and all of these were created, they were very heavily sort of logic systems.","startTime":"03:54","endTime":"04:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They were doing logic in contained environments, very big sort of if then else sort of things work through the logic tree and everything.","startTime":"04:05","endTime":"04:14","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I suspect maybe what we all sort of as a society thought was that when we make AI better, it's going to be a generalization of that.","startTime":"04:15","endTime":"04:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's going to do logic in more environments, better, in more varied places.","startTime":"04:25","endTime":"04:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And what happened with deep learning was we created something that was very different.","startTime":"04:32","endTime":"04:37","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Deep learning, I think, is very much like system one.","startTime":"04:38","endTime":"04:41","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's not particularly good at reasoning, but it is very good at creating and generating these tokens or lms that we talking about generating these tokens and doing, you know, making music and stuff like that.","startTime":"04:41","endTime":"04:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think that has been a little bit of a shock to me, at least in terms of what was expected, in terms of where were going to go with increasing AI.","startTime":"04:55","endTime":"05:07","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm curious if other people feel that way or like people.","startTime":"05:08","endTime":"05:12","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Many people disagree.","startTime":"05:12","endTime":"05:13","speaker_name":"speaker

people feel like this has been a surprise to you?","startTime":"05:18","endTime":"05:21","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or maybe this is something people.","startTime":"05:22","endTime":"05:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right there.","startTime":"05:23","endTime":"05:23","speaker_name":"speaker

learning.","startTime":"05:26","endTime":"05:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so what that, what that led to is I think what's going to take.","startTime":"05:28","endTime":"05:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's going to take us all collectively some time.","startTime":"05:35","endTime":"05:37","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But for me, it has been like, okay, what does it mean to be human after?","startTime":"05:37","endTime":"05:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, our existing mental model of what it means to be human seems to be, oh, okay, all right.","startTime":"05:41","endTime":"05:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is this better?","startTime":"05:49","endTime":"05:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so our existing mental model of what it means to be human seems to be a little bit flipped in my mind.","startTime":"05:50","endTime":"05:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that has led to wondering what, you know, what it is that.","startTime":"05:57","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And maybe it isn't so much about system one and system two.","startTime":"06:02","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe it isn't so much about that we can do creative things or between logic.","startTime":"06:05","endTime":"06:10","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And maybe it is that we don't necessarily need to switch back and forth.","startTime":"06:11","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We seamlessly integrate intuition and logic and we figure out very easily where you want to use logic.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:24","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it comes very naturally.","startTime":"06:24","endTime":"06:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But anyway, that is one of the sort of like things, what that led to sort of like thinking further thinking is where do we go from here?","startTime":"06:27","endTime":"06:38","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What is our future with AI going forward?","startTime":"06:38","endTime":"06:41","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you know, I'm curious how many people here have a belief that.","startTime":"06:43","endTime":"06:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's been a lot of talk of AI hitting the scaling wall.","startTime":"06:50","endTime":"06:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm curious how many people here believe that we're hitting a scaling wall or we're hitting a wall in terms of progression of AI.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"07:00","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not necessarily that we won't be adding more capabilities, but that it has slowed down versus that we will keep going.","startTime":"07:00","endTime":"07:07","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So many people believe we have slowed down.","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, good number of people, but still very optimistic group.","startTime":"07:11","endTime":"07:15","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Most people seem to believe that we will continue to make progress nonetheless.","startTime":"07:15","endTime":"07:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One of the things that I was wondering when I was thinking about, okay, like what if worst case scenario, we can't make better intelligence?","startTime":"07:20","endTime":"07:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is as good as it's going to get.","startTime":"07:29","endTime":"07:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, maybe we'll continue to improve and add capabilities, maybe we'll continue to add arms and legs and more tools and things like that, but the core intelligence is maybe not going to substantially change in the future.","startTime":"07:31","endTime":"07:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What does it mean for us?","startTime":"07:46","endTime":"07:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And one of the good things, one of the positive things that sort of still exists even in this worst case scenario is we have historically very good capabilities of taking things like what we have right now is a kernel of intelligence, like this little piece, this little sort of thing that we know is new.","startTime":"07:48","endTime":"08:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we haven't had a capability, we haven't had a control.","startTime":"08:08","endTime":"08:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And even if it doesn't increase or doesn't go anywhere, we can still build on top of it.","startTime":"08:11","endTime":"08:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So for example, we have, you know, once transistors were meant to, people were able to figure out how to scale them and people were able to figure out how to configure and reconfigure them in many different ways and build a whole computing revolution.","startTime":"08:17","endTime":"08:30","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then the same with packet switching.","startTime":"08:31","endTime":"08:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Once people, somebody came up with the idea of packet switching and sending it over across the Internet, then we have Internet revolution.","startTime":"08:33","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think what's going to happen here is basically we're going to end up seeing combination of this kernel of intelligence.","startTime":"08:41","endTime":"08:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Even the worst case scenario, this kernel of intelligence will be combined and recombined again and again in many different ways to have sort of a revolution change.","startTime":"08:48","endTime":"08:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think that's maybe what we're saying is agent, right?","startTime":"08:57","endTime":"09:01","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like we're seeing a lot of different, a lot of talk about why this is the decade of agent or year of Agent or whatever, maybe.","startTime":"09:01","endTime":"09:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And this might go on for a while, but.","startTime":"09:09","endTime":"09:12","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I'm very optimistic that we're going to take that and build sort of like really fantastic systems that will change things in the future.","startTime":"09:12","endTime":"09:22","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So as we are doing that, one critical question that comes to us, like, how do we make sure it works?","startTime":"09:23","endTime":"09:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"These things work the way that we want them to work.","startTime":"09:28","endTime":"09:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So just by a show of hands, how many people have tried to deploy an AI agent or an AI system of some kind in production?","startTime":"09:32","endTime":"09:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"09:41","endTime":"09:42","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And of the people, how many of you have built an evaluation?","startTime":"09:42","endTime":"09:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"About half of the people.","startTime":"09:49","endTime":"09:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's good.","startTime":"09:50","endTime":"09:51","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's like, better than I thought.","startTime":"09:51","endTime":"09:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we're gonna talk a little bit about that.","startTime":"09:55","endTime":"09:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And before we get into that, how many people have a good understanding of language is generated in mms, like tokenizers, so on and so forth?","startTime":"09:59","endTime":"10:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Most people.","startTime":"10:09","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Great.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I think as these models.","startTime":"10:11","endTime":"10:12","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So basically what is happening, I'll just like recap real quick as is, these models are mostly just like, put math in, get math out.","startTime":"10:12","endTime":"10:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, put numbers in, get numbers out.","startTime":"10:19","endTime":"10:21","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Machines, they can't really do anything else.","startTime":"10:21","endTime":"10:24","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They can really generate language or consume language.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No neural network can and.","startTime":"10:28","endTime":"10:30","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or images or anything else.","startTime":"10:30","endTime":"10:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So to create something useful, what we need to do is we need to come up with some sort of an interpretation of the real world and translate these things into numbers, which, in case of language, is the embeddings.","startTime":"10:33","endTime":"10:44","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:44","endTime":"10:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And take the numbers that come out of these networks and translate that back to some sort of language, which is what we do.","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"10:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And what that leads to is this interesting thing where, because we're not sure that the model understands really fundamentally, and this is like a long debate, so I don't think we're going to resolve that here today.","startTime":"10:53","endTime":"11:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But we're not sure that the model really understands what it is doing because what it sees is these embedded numbers and what it spits out is numbers.","startTime":"11:06","endTime":"11:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we decide the interpretation.","startTime":"11:18","endTime":"11:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We come up with, hey, I'm going to take the last layer and I'm going to do softmax.","startTime":"11:20","endTime":"11:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm going to assume that's kind of like a probability of what token or what word the model wanted to give me in the future, or as the prediction of the next word.","startTime":"11:25","endTime":"11:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What that leads to is something I think is called, like, what I like to think of it as, like, the intelligence envelope of an AI model is in Congress.","startTime":"11:37","endTime":"11:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's like the term is jagged frontier.","startTime":"11:46","endTime":"11:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"11:49","endTime":"11:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And what that means is you have something that you expect it to do really well, and it doesn't really do well at that.","startTime":"11:49","endTime":"11:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I am curious if there are people who have some examples of things that they fully expected the AI to do well because they've seen it do other things really well.","startTime":"11:57","endTime":"12:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we're surprised that the models were really struggling with that particular use case.","startTime":"12:07","endTime":"12:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I have one.","startTime":"12:11","endTime":"12:12","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm curious if nobody wants to share any that they have.","startTime":"12:13","endTime":"12:15","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:16","endTime":"12:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Comparing to numbers.","startTime":"12:22","endTime":"12:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"12:23","endTime":"12:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's a very good classic.","startTime":"12:23","endTime":"12:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Brainstorming.","startTime":"12:41","endTime":"12:41","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's amazing.","startTime":"12:41","endTime":"12:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But when you give numbers.","startTime":"12:44","endTime":"12:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:51","endTime":"12:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So analysis, processing of numbers.","startTime":"12:52","endTime":"12:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Doing basic math really struggles at basic math.","startTime":"12:54","endTime":"12:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"My use case was my partner has a calendar on the wall and she travels a lot and she puts a blue market time.","startTime":"12:58","endTime":"13:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"She's not maybe in the city.","startTime":"13:06","endTime":"13:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we wanted to know, like, how many days have you been not in the city?","startTime":"13:08","endTime":"13:12","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I take a picture and I fed it to a model, and I fed it to all the models, actually.","startTime":"13:12","endTime":"13:16","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I was like, well, count the number of blue lines on this calendar, which is the year of the calendar.","startTime":"13:16","endTime":"13:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And every model failed miserably.","startTime":"13:20","endTime":"13:22","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it's not a complicated task.","startTime":"13:22","endTime":"13:24","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"These models are very good at image processing.","startTime":"13:24","endTime":"13:26","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They can look at images of weather patterns and predict all these things.","startTime":"13:26","endTime":"13:30","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I guess counting blue lines is not in the training data set.","startTime":"13:30","endTime":"13:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that was kind of like, okay, there is a lot here that you expect a model to be able to do.","startTime":"13:34","endTime":"13:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the reason you expect the model to be able to do it because you're projecting how human intelligence and love works in terms of, like, you see a person that is able to do certain set of things, and then you interpolate that they will also be able to do this task if they know how to count and they know how to look at a picture, and so on and so forth.","startTime":"13:43","endTime":"14:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then you assume that they'll be able to count the number of blue lines in an image, which I think is a reasonable assumption for people, but not so much for animals.","startTime":"14:05","endTime":"14:14","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what that does is it really necessitates if you are doing a particular task with the model, it necessarily you trying to build an UL for that particular task.","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"14:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what you want to do is you want to say, like, hey, here's my task, and I'm going to make sure that.","startTime":"14:26","endTime":"14:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's call it system under test.","startTime":"14:32","endTime":"14:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, like, you have a system under test which could be an agent, could be a model, could be some, you know, whatever it is.","startTime":"14:34","endTime":"14:39","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you want to make sure that system under test does really well on your task.","startTime":"14:40","endTime":"14:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so for that, what you want to do is build an eval.","startTime":"14:46","endTime":"14:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And an eval is, you know, my working definition of an eval is basically it's an ordering in the space of these systems.","startTime":"14:49","endTime":"14:55","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you have a set of space of systems and what you're trying to do is create an order on it, ordering on it for your task.","startTime":"14:55","endTime":"15:02","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the one at the top is maybe the best at your task, and so on and so forth.","startTime":"15:02","endTime":"15:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or maybe you're trying to create a score.","startTime":"15:06","endTime":"15:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now, models, as we discussed earlier, are just sort of a collection of weights and some number.","startTime":"15:09","endTime":"15:15","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They don't admit any kind of natural ordering.","startTime":"15:16","endTime":"15:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you have to come up with some way to create this order.","startTime":"15:18","endTime":"15:21","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so that's sort of what an eval is.","startTime":"15:22","endTime":"15:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Wonder if anybody has like a definition of eval that maybe they want to share that makes sense or any additions or refinements to that working definition.","startTime":"15:25","endTime":"15:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because okay, so maybe let's go with that definition and let's talk about how we build this eval.","startTime":"15:34","endTime":"15:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now, we don't have a natural way of ordering these models, so we're gonna have to do something where we say, okay, we are going to sample outputs from the models because this is the only observable thing we have.","startTime":"15:44","endTime":"15:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we will take sampling of outputs of the model and rank those samples.","startTime":"15:59","endTime":"16:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So building an eval is inherently about doing two things.","startTime":"16:04","endTime":"16:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's coming up with a sample that is representative of your task and then getting the responses from these models and then coming up with ways of ranking those responses and creating a score out of it.","startTime":"16:08","endTime":"16:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's sort of like a very high level process of how you build an ebal.","startTime":"16:20","endTime":"16:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Curious if people have gone through it, what are the challenges you faced?","startTime":"16:26","endTime":"16:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we can talk about that.","startTime":"16:29","endTime":"16:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"16:33","endTime":"16:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, I have not done evil, but I wanted to start with it.","startTime":"16:39","endTime":"16:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm the founder of a fintech startup, so it's very important for us that our agent doesn't overstep with investment advising and stuff like that.","startTime":"16:42","endTime":"16:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's a B2C product, so it's.","startTime":"16:52","endTime":"16:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Very crucial for us.","startTime":"16:53","endTime":"16:55","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I have a lot of user conversations, stuff like that.","startTime":"16:56","endTime":"16:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But what I don't get is how to sample the right way questions.","startTime":"16:59","endTime":"17:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because I like to think of it like LLMs are ambiguous.","startTime":"17:03","endTime":"17:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"People can come up with all kind of stuff, all kind of things.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I know my domain is finance and I know I have a general idea of what the questions will be, but it's like much broader.","startTime":"17:10","endTime":"17:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So how to sample it in a way that I cover most of the scenarios that I want to test, which I'm not aware of, but I know the Persona of the consumers who are.","startTime":"17:17","endTime":"17:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Going to use it.","startTime":"17:26","endTime":"17:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that means.","startTime":"17:28","endTime":"17:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, we work with a bunch of vertical AI companies building evals for them and also fine tuning custom evaluation models.","startTime":"17:32","endTime":"17:39","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"One very common problem that we see is the misalignment between human evaluators.","startTime":"17:39","endTime":"17:46","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you might have several different people working even at the same company who evaluate the outputs in completely different ways.","startTime":"17:46","endTime":"17:52","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you struggle with the alignment.","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"17:54","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then if you end up using an LLM judge, so an LLM to judge the outputs, it's very hard to get it to correlate with your humans.","startTime":"17:54","endTime":"18:03","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So making it annotate and review in the same way as your humans would to prompt.","startTime":"18:04","endTime":"18:09","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's a very complicated problem with evals.","startTime":"18:10","endTime":"18:16","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you know, there are ways to sort of like mitigate it, but I don't know if there's a solution to that.","startTime":"18:16","endTime":"18:22","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But.","startTime":"18:22","endTime":"18:22","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so I'm gonna take a step back and one of the things I want to do before, like, so that I talk more about emails, is maybe people can spend, you know, while they're, while we're going through the session thinking about some particular use case.","startTime":"18:23","endTime":"18:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I wonder if, like, maybe it's a good idea for us to pick a use case and then just walk through building an eval for that use case.","startTime":"18:37","endTime":"18:44","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if people have use cases, let's sort of like pick one in the end, hopefully not too much towards the end, and then we'll sort of like talk through how we build evals.","startTime":"18:44","endTime":"18:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But let me talk in abstract on the process of building evals, the type of evals that exist, and then we'll get to that.","startTime":"18:53","endTime":"19:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So at a high level, the simplest thing that I can think of for building an eval is something like a human evaluation, which is sort of take a set of questions from your real life data.","startTime":"19:04","endTime":"19:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Whatever your task is, build 500 of those tasks.","startTime":"19:18","endTime":"19:22","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you are, if it's a question answering thing, write 500 questions that is representative of what your sort of like task is.","startTime":"19:22","endTime":"19:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that is a classical statistical problem.","startTime":"19:31","endTime":"19:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do I find the sample that is represented and all that.","startTime":"19:34","endTime":"19:37","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But once you have that, what you can do is you can have two models answer those questions and take all these responses.","startTime":"19:38","endTime":"19:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So now you have like, you know, thousand responses, 500 from each of the models.","startTime":"19:45","endTime":"19:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And take the pairs, this is sort of like a paired T test in a way, and send it to humans and say, like, which one of these two do you like more?","startTime":"19:49","endTime":"19:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that is maybe the simplest way to build an eval, which is A human eval.","startTime":"19:58","endTime":"20:02","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And once you get the response, you get some.","startTime":"20:02","endTime":"20:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can create a metric out of it.","startTime":"20:04","endTime":"20:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can say like, this is the net win rate or something.","startTime":"20:06","endTime":"20:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then you know which model is sort of doing better.","startTime":"20:09","endTime":"20:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now, this all depends on how representative or how good, which is sort of the problem you were describing this particular sample is this kind of works reasonably well when the models are far apart in capability, but it really is very dependent on, you know, how good the humans are.","startTime":"20:11","endTime":"20:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"When the models are close enough.","startTime":"20:34","endTime":"20:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"20:35","endTime":"20:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or the systems are closed enough, how good the humans are able to being able to distinguish these responses.","startTime":"20:36","endTime":"20:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's a lot of subjectivity.","startTime":"20:43","endTime":"20:44","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can have like three people do it and you get a majority vote and all of that.","startTime":"20:44","endTime":"20:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But.","startTime":"20:48","endTime":"20:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it's still challenges.","startTime":"20:48","endTime":"20:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One of the biggest challenges which I think you already highlighted is people don't agree with other people.","startTime":"20:50","endTime":"20:55","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Interrater agreement is very poor amongst humans, and that creates a challenge.","startTime":"20:55","endTime":"21:01","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so what is the next most reasonable thing maybe that we can do here?","startTime":"21:01","endTime":"21:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There are two problems to solve.","startTime":"21:07","endTime":"21:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One is of accuracy.","startTime":"21:08","endTime":"21:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do we get better evals?","startTime":"21:09","endTime":"21:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The second is this is extremely expensive to run a single eval if you have to send all the responses.","startTime":"21:11","endTime":"21:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now, let's say you're trying to compare 10 models.","startTime":"21:18","endTime":"21:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You have like an exploding combination of pairs of responses to send to human evaluators.","startTime":"21:21","endTime":"21:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if you're doing three.","startTime":"21:27","endTime":"21:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's.","startTime":"21:29","endTime":"21:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is getting expensive now, right?","startTime":"21:29","endTime":"21:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's one problem to solve.","startTime":"21:32","endTime":"21:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The second is accuracy.","startTime":"21:33","endTime":"21:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you make sure that.","startTime":"21:35","endTime":"21:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, I don't know that you can all ever make sure, but how do you mitigate, you know, the sort of, like the bias that comes in and any obvious ideas here?","startTime":"21:36","endTime":"21:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, so.","startTime":"21:49","endTime":"22:14","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the idea is do multiple people and take a majority vote.","startTime":"22:15","endTime":"22:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Certainly helps increases your cost.","startTime":"22:19","endTime":"22:21","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So let's tackle the cost problem first.","startTime":"22:22","endTime":"22:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, how do we tackle the cost problem of this?","startTime":"22:23","endTime":"22:26","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How can we make this?","startTime":"22:26","endTime":"22:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And that's like an auto eval, which is something that you can run.","startTime":"22:27","endTime":"22:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Ideally, what you want to be able to do is run eval in 30 minutes or so on your samples.","startTime":"22:32","endTime":"22:37","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You don't want to wait days for people to view the data and all of that.","startTime":"22:37","endTime":"22:41","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And in.","startTime":"22:42","endTime":"22:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In terms of auto eval, there are a few different ways of doing it.","startTime":"22:43","endTime":"22:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The most classical way of doing an auto eval, and we talked a little bit about how neural networks generate, you know, numbers, and you take a soft max in the end, right?","startTime":"22:46","endTime":"22:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you say, this is the next token, and so on and so forth.","startTime":"22:54","endTime":"22:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What you're really getting out of the model is a probability distribution of what it thinks is the answer.","startTime":"22:57","endTime":"23:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so what you can do is you can have multiple choice questions.","startTime":"23:05","endTime":"23:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And this is sort of like the format that is followed by a lot of some of the early sort of open source evals as well, like NMLU and stuff where you have multiple choice questions and you look at the probability of the answers, you ignore all the other things so that, so the model may not answer the question correctly at all, but you only look at the probability of the tokens you're interested in and you ignore everything else.","startTime":"23:08","endTime":"23:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you have four options, you look at the probability of just those four and you see which one has the highest probability and you say that's maybe I'm going to assume that's the choice of the network, right?","startTime":"23:35","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, and with that you get a contained space and a very nice way of calculating a score.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:51","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This does not represent necessarily what the model would have answered if it was asked to answer.","startTime":"23:52","endTime":"23:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You're not even generating language actually, you're just looking at the probabilities and sort of calculating a score.","startTime":"23:59","endTime":"24:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But this kind of, this method kind of works in a crude way.","startTime":"24:05","endTime":"24:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It is also a very powerful, very helpful method in early model training.","startTime":"24:08","endTime":"24:14","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So when you're pre training your models and the models are not very smart at that point, you want something that is kind of contained, you only look at the four or five options.","startTime":"24:14","endTime":"24:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Even if the model was going to get it wrong almost all the time, you know between these four that it's like more likely to generate this answer.","startTime":"24:26","endTime":"24:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you always have some kind of scoring mechanism and you can see as your training models early on, during pre training, these kind of evals are very helpful because you can see whether it's learning anything at all.","startTime":"24:35","endTime":"24:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not that it's good at answering the questions, but is there any intelligence that is being accumulated during training at all?","startTime":"24:45","endTime":"24:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's one way of doing an eval and it actually works reasonably well for these type of use cases.","startTime":"24:51","endTime":"24:58","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it is kind of falling out of fashion because of the very contained environment.","startTime":"24:58","endTime":"25:01","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's only so many things you can put in the multiple choice question.","startTime":"25:02","endTime":"25:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And most of the tasks in real life are not multiple choice.","startTime":"25:05","endTime":"25:07","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like I think it's fair to say that people are not really using AI to answer multiple choice questions all the time.","startTime":"25:07","endTime":"25:14","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then you have like longer term text that you're trying to get answer out of the AI and you are like, okay, I need to well figure out how to get this.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And there are maybe A few different ways of doing it, but the simplest one is you ask the AI for answer and you write a parser in Python or Rust or whatever it is that you like and you say like, okay, I'm going to ask you to answer this question and I will specify a format in which to answer the question and then I will parse that and I will check that answer against a real answer.","startTime":"25:23","endTime":"25:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Kind of works for long form text.","startTime":"25:48","endTime":"25:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But again, the problem is the answers have to be deterministic and contained.","startTime":"25:50","endTime":"25:55","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So a third approach, which is really becoming much more popular these days, is you replace the human in the human eval with a model and you ask the model about which response is better.","startTime":"25:57","endTime":"26:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this is like maybe the simplest form of a LLM as a judge eval where you say like, okay, I'm gonna send these pairs of responses to models and this is very cheap obviously, and you can do this very fast and ask the model which one is better and you're gonna get some response.","startTime":"26:09","endTime":"26:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you do the model well, you prompt the model well, sometimes you can even fine tune the model on your responses.","startTime":"26:26","endTime":"26:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But if you do this well, you can get just about as much agreement with humans as humans get with each other.","startTime":"26:32","endTime":"26:41","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can do like, put in a lot of effort and you can get to that place, not a happy place because again, like humans often won't agree with each other.","startTime":"26:41","endTime":"26:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sometimes it's less than 60, 50, 60% of the time.","startTime":"26:49","endTime":"26:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But you've sort of made progress.","startTime":"26:53","endTime":"26:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You've actually, you haven't solved the problem of accuracy, but you have solved the problem of cost, which where you're saying, okay, like I can now run these things in a reasonable amount of time.","startTime":"26:54","endTime":"27:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For many use cases, this is actually quite a step up from sort of just feeling whether your model or your system under test is working very well or not.","startTime":"27:03","endTime":"27:13","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But let's talk about what more can you do here.","startTime":"27:15","endTime":"27:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What is, you know, what is maybe a simplistic idea of something here that may help us make this even better.","startTime":"27:20","endTime":"27:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Any ideas, any thoughts?","startTime":"27:27","endTime":"27:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"27:32","endTime":"27:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"50 model and we want to do human evaluation.","startTime":"27:37","endTime":"27:40","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Then first we will make two clusters, like two group of the model and we'll take like most common are like answer or like the most representative answer of that classroom.","startTime":"27:41","endTime":"27:53","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Then we will ask our human, okay, out of these two respons, which is better with human says this response is better.","startTime":"27:53","endTime":"28:00","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Then we will have a look in all of the response in that particular cluster and again make two clusters out of it.","startTime":"28:00","endTime":"28:09","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So like we will remove the half of the number of models at every evaluation.","startTime":"28:09","endTime":"28:15","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And by doing so, we can evaluate a lot of models very quickly.","startTime":"28:16","endTime":"28:20","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So yeah, you can have some sort of like a human sort of check on the model evaluations and build an arena of sorts.","startTime":"28:23","endTime":"28:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the arena do.","startTime":"28:31","endTime":"28:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It still doesn't sort of fundamentally solve the problem of the LLM sort of, you're giving the LLM a lot of unguided sort of, you're asking for an unguided thing.","startTime":"28:33","endTime":"28:44","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So one of the things you can do is prepare some sort of like a rubric or a constitution for the model to say, like, hey, here's my criteria.","startTime":"28:44","endTime":"28:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Here is a question, response, A, response B, based on this criteria, can you tell me if you know if the response is better, which response is better and if your criteria is objective, if you are in a very lucky sort of environment where you kind of know what good looks like, then this works pretty well.","startTime":"28:55","endTime":"29:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But a lot of the times you don't know what good looks like.","startTime":"29:18","endTime":"29:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"In fact, I have suffered from this where we are convinced, you're convinced that good looks like this, and then you find out that's good.","startTime":"29:23","endTime":"29:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not really what people think good is.","startTime":"29:34","endTime":"29:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like what you think good isn't what.","startTime":"29:35","endTime":"29:37","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you've been sort of directing your models to choose better responses based on what you thought was good.","startTime":"29:37","endTime":"29:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then it turns out that wasn't exactly what people thought was good.","startTime":"29:44","endTime":"29:47","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what you want to do is you want to try and there.","startTime":"29:49","endTime":"29:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We'll come back to this.","startTime":"29:53","endTime":"29:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There are a couple ways of figuring out what good looks like and sort of coming up with these rubrics.","startTime":"29:54","endTime":"29:58","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But you can mitigate this problem in another way, which is you can actually sort of have, instead of having higher level criteria for the model, you can have prompt specific rubrics where you take a particular question.","startTime":"29:58","endTime":"30:14","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'll give an example.","startTime":"30:15","endTime":"30:16","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like let's say your question was, you know, give me the top three basketball players in the 80s by the number of three pointers that they shot and then maybe rank them based on the day each one of them joined the league or something like that.","startTime":"30:16","endTime":"30:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can obviously check this question.","startTime":"30:37","endTime":"30:38","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, this is not a particularly hard question for LLMs of today to check, but you can imagine like a more complex question.","startTime":"30:38","endTime":"30:44","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And what you can do is you can write a rubric that has specific criteria for that question that says, hey, you know, is this person on the list?","startTime":"30:44","endTime":"30:55","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's your one criteria.","startTime":"30:56","endTime":"30:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is this another person on the list?","startTime":"30:57","endTime":"30:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Does the list Contain three items like so on and so forth.","startTime":"30:59","endTime":"31:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you can have very detailed list.","startTime":"31:03","endTime":"31:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now it doesn't seem like on the surface that this has much more value over just giving answer and checking, but it has a very sort of critical advantage which is partial credit, which is when failure happens in models.","startTime":"31:05","endTime":"31:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You are going to be able to see when models fail entirely versus partial.","startTime":"31:20","endTime":"31:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And remember the problem that were trying to solve in the first place, the problem were trying to solve was when models get close in performance, we have a hard time distinguishing because our criteria is not particularly fine grained because we don't have a way of telling what good objectively is.","startTime":"31:26","endTime":"31:44","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what we're trying to do here is sort of circumventing the problem by increasing resolution on the things that we know while sort of still ignoring the things that are more subjective and we don't know about.","startTime":"31:44","endTime":"31:58","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's sort of like what we're trying to do here.","startTime":"31:58","endTime":"32:01","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And interestingly, this works pretty well.","startTime":"32:02","endTime":"32:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like it doesn't solve the problem of state style this particular way, but you can now start to get creative about it.","startTime":"32:05","endTime":"32:14","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You could be like, okay, now I have ways of maybe solving the problem of style.","startTime":"32:14","endTime":"32:18","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe for this response a good response would be a bulleted list.","startTime":"32:18","endTime":"32:21","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe for another response a good response would look like something different.","startTime":"32:22","endTime":"32:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because my rubric is not general and specific to the particular problem, I can be actually a little bit more prescriptive and it's not going to damage my overall eval too much because if I mess up in one of the 500 or thousand questions, as long as by and large at the high level I have, you know, the right thing, I'm going to get both a high resolution on models and I'm going to be able to get like a number that I want.","startTime":"32:26","endTime":"32:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"32:52","endTime":"32:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's sort of like another way of getting around.","startTime":"32:52","endTime":"32:55","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So okay, let's keep building on that.","startTime":"32:58","endTime":"32:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What more can we do?","startTime":"32:59","endTime":"33:00","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How can we improve this further?","startTime":"33:00","endTime":"33:02","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How can we improve.","startTime":"33:02","endTime":"33:02","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"33:03","endTime":"33:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It'S scary to do this, but so my biggest concern is with hallucination.","startTime":"33:08","endTime":"33:12","speaker_name":"speaker 5","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And I had thought that consensus would be helpful in some ways instead of just evaluation to see how many of these models are responding with the same thing.","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:20","speaker_name":"speaker 5","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Yeah, you mean like consensus between models to solve the hallucination problem.","startTime":"33:23","endTime":"33:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's like if you're both on acid and you ask each other are you seeing?","startTime":"33:29","endTime":"33:32","speaker_name":"speaker 5","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"33:32","endTime":"33:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's why you don't want, you don't.","startTime":"33:34","endTime":"33:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, so this goes into actually how do you judge the Quality of a judge question, which is I am asking models to evaluate what things are.","startTime":"33:36","endTime":"33:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And as much as I'm giving it, you know, specific objective rubrics and criteria, sometimes if you look at the data, you will see that it's just going to be like, oh, the question was this, and you told me this is the answer.","startTime":"33:46","endTime":"34:00","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But actually I think the LLMs answer was right and I'm going to give it the points.","startTime":"34:00","endTime":"34:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think you were wrong.","startTime":"34:04","endTime":"34:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like this happens.","startTime":"34:05","endTime":"34:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"34:06","endTime":"34:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like the model will just decide that.","startTime":"34:06","endTime":"34:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I think in this, because this is a very contained scenario, you can get around it without solving the broader hallucination problem with basically just a little bit of fine tuning of that particular model on the set.","startTime":"34:10","endTime":"34:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Remember, this is your eval set.","startTime":"34:25","endTime":"34:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You don't really care if your model is massively overfit on the eval set.","startTime":"34:28","endTime":"34:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You're not trying to use it as a reward model.","startTime":"34:31","endTime":"34:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you're not using it as a reward model, it's only ever going to be used to evaluate these particular prompts.","startTime":"34:34","endTime":"34:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It can be overfit on these prompts without actually having any sort of side effects.","startTime":"34:40","endTime":"34:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now obviously you have to be careful not to use it as a reward model because once you start doing that's going to be problematic.","startTime":"34:47","endTime":"34:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe a word of caution, like never ever use judge models or reward models.","startTime":"34:53","endTime":"34:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There is not a lot of difference in training a good judge model or reward model, especially in complex scenarios where you are building these reinforcement learning simulation scenarios.","startTime":"34:59","endTime":"35:10","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you will use maybe the same infrastructure oftentimes to do reinforcement learning as you're going to do for evals.","startTime":"35:11","endTime":"35:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"35:19","endTime":"35:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For complex evals where like the world is changing and you need a validation function, you're going to have these environments and in these environments you're going to be doing both of the same things.","startTime":"35:20","endTime":"35:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the temptation is very high to sort of like use these models that you are using for evaluation to then just give feedback to the model during training.","startTime":"35:29","endTime":"35:39","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I strongly sort of suggest not doing that.","startTime":"35:39","endTime":"35:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I was just wondering, can I request like an example to understand the concept better?","startTime":"35:45","endTime":"35:52","speaker_name":"speaker 6","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like to give some context about it.","startTime":"35:52","endTime":"35:55","speaker_name":"speaker 6","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Recently there was a report about a consultancy provide producing an AI generated report with a lawyer.","startTime":"35:55","endTime":"36:01","speaker_name":"speaker 6","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So hypothetically speaking, how would we add in?","startTime":"36:03","endTime":"36:06","speaker_name":"speaker 6","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah, so I think there's maybe two parts to the question.","startTime":"36:07","endTime":"36:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"One is how do you create a hallucination evaluation?","startTime":"36:12","endTime":"36:16","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And second is how do you create an agent that doesn't hallucinate as much?","startTime":"36:17","endTime":"36:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think for the second one, I'm sure, like I don't know what they were using for the second one, the agent that doesn't hallucinate that much.","startTime":"36:24","endTime":"36:30","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's only so much we can do, right?","startTime":"36:30","endTime":"36:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, we can sort of try and create.","startTime":"36:32","endTime":"36:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We can try and create, you know, checks and like, you have, like, a secondary agent that goes and checks sources and makes sure.","startTime":"36:35","endTime":"36:42","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then you have a tertiary agent that actually checks it, and that can reduce a lot.","startTime":"36:42","endTime":"36:47","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But going back to sort of the eval problem, how do you create an eval for hallucination that's like, there's.","startTime":"36:47","endTime":"36:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's a good amount of work on this.","startTime":"36:54","endTime":"36:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, this is.","startTime":"36:56","endTime":"36:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is a field that has, like, a good amount of research on it.","startTime":"36:56","endTime":"37:00","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And maybe what you want to do is basically you want to come up with.","startTime":"37:00","endTime":"37:04","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So once you've built your agent that you think isn't going to hallucinate in these use cases, and you're sort of like wanting to evaluate it on some hallucination benchmark, you come up with questions and problems that will cause models to hallucinate.","startTime":"37:04","endTime":"37:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, you know, a fun question that, you know, one time I was sort of testing the models was maybe a friend of mine sent me this was, what if?","startTime":"37:19","endTime":"37:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, you asked the LLM, what if?","startTime":"37:29","endTime":"37:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What if?","startTime":"37:31","endTime":"37:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What would have happened if the.","startTime":"37:31","endTime":"37:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The Americans had lost the first battle of Saratoga or something like that?","startTime":"37:33","endTime":"37:37","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And the model sort of like starts to go into and say, well, if they had lost the first one, the second one would have been difficult.","startTime":"37:37","endTime":"37:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And like, all this kind of like trying to give you all these explanations and all that, when in fact, that is what had happened.","startTime":"37:43","endTime":"37:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it completely hallucinated because it was not even in the frame of reference of the model to be like it was taking the statement you made as a factual statement and sort of extrapolating from that what it thinks would have happened in the world where in fact your statement in the first place.","startTime":"37:50","endTime":"38:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can come up with a lot of these type of ideas.","startTime":"38:07","endTime":"38:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I don't know that building an eval for hallucination is particularly technically any different than building any other eval.","startTime":"38:09","endTime":"38:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it is a creative problem and oftentimes a practical sort of thing that I've seen that works pretty well with not just this type of problem, but many is when you're building the eval and coming up with these sort of questions and scenarios, it really pays off to have two people go back and forth on what those problems might look like.","startTime":"38:17","endTime":"38:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Two or more.","startTime":"38:41","endTime":"38:41","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"When people brainstorm it, rather than one person creatively coming up with these situations, the results tend to be substantially better.","startTime":"38:42","endTime":"38:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, so maybe that's sort of like a, you know, a practical sort of like thing there.","startTime":"38:50","endTime":"38:55","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, let's do a time check.","startTime":"38:56","endTime":"38:57","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think we're maybe on time.","startTime":"38:59","endTime":"39:01","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What I did want to do is take an example somebody has and see if we could talk through how we can build an esophagus.","startTime":"39:01","endTime":"39:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"39:18","endTime":"39:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I run a youth mental health company which is a super high stakes use case.","startTime":"39:22","endTime":"39:26","speaker_name":"speaker

suicidality, self harm and so on.","startTime":"39:26","endTime":"39:33","speaker_name":"speaker 5","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So how do you think about these cases where there might be low incidences?","startTime":"39:34","endTime":"39:38","speaker_name":"speaker 5","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"For example, someone messed up.","startTime":"39:38","endTime":"39:40","speaker_name":"speaker 5","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"There's not that many that we're going to see, but it's really important.","startTime":"39:40","endTime":"39:44","speaker_name":"speaker 5","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Yeah, tricky use case.","startTime":"39:46","endTime":"39:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like when the data is really sparse, like what do you do?","startTime":"39:49","endTime":"39:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like how do you, I think one of the luxuries that you have in the eval space is you create the set.","startTime":"39:52","endTime":"40:00","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can, if you can trigger these things with higher incidents, that's how you sort of start to create your data set.","startTime":"40:00","endTime":"40:07","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's kind of like what would, what you would try to do is you would try to.","startTime":"40:07","endTime":"40:11","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And these are adversarial approaches of creating evals.","startTime":"40:11","endTime":"40:15","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this works actually not just in these situations, but also like a lot of other situations where you're trying to get, figure out model failure rates of various different types.","startTime":"40:15","endTime":"40:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And one of the things that models are particularly bad at is combining different threads of reasoning.","startTime":"40:24","endTime":"40:30","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So people have no problem coming up with combining like reasoning.","startTime":"40:30","endTime":"40:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It could be shallow reasoning, not complicated, shallow reasoning of different fiber, different things.","startTime":"40:36","endTime":"40:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And people have no problem combining them.","startTime":"40:41","endTime":"40:44","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But AI models really struggle.","startTime":"40:44","endTime":"40:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They can go really deep in reasoning because we've been training these reasoning models lately and they can go really deep into one thing.","startTime":"40:45","endTime":"40:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But then the moment you sort of add a couple of constraints or try and get them to combine.","startTime":"40:54","endTime":"40:58","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so that has been an interesting recipe to get models to fail.","startTime":"40:58","endTime":"41:02","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then sort of like when you get these failure rates, you capture them in the eval and you say, okay, now I'm going to try to build my agents that will sort of like mitigate this particular problem.","startTime":"41:02","endTime":"41:15","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I mean, I think this is a problem where you would have a very hard time building a real world eval and you want a synthetic set of data that elicits these failure rates and then you want to climb your agent on it and make sure your agent doesn't do that.","startTime":"41:15","endTime":"41:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So anyway, so that's like a.","startTime":"41:35","endTime":"41:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"A lot of talk about evals, I guess, since we're on
