do.","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you're using AI tools to sort of combat that.","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:28","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I do always wonder if that is a technical issue or a culture cultural issue because we're still

1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just think it's a very hard thing to overcome.","startTime":"05:41","endTime":"05:46","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think everyone is on social for different reasons.","startTime":"05:46","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Some people say that they're tired of the toxicity, but they're the first to comment and jump in and dunk on someone.","startTime":"05:50","endTime":"05:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That said, we think of these things as almost like smaller micro communities of really trusted people that you can eventually, with all these agents and everything that's coming online where they can befriend you and they can fake like an actual human.","startTime":"05:58","endTime":"06:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have to break this apart into verifiable, trustable, small micro communities around a theme, a topic.","startTime":"06:10","endTime":"06:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if we can create that intimacy and that idea of real connection with other humans, I think that's a huge win.","startTime":"06:16","endTime":"06:22","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You don't need many people coming together to create like really highly valuable content and community around that.","startTime":"06:22","endTime":"06:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So when we think about some of these things here, like dig for fun, dig to learn, dig for stay, those are kind of curated feeds that you can customize and say I want more of this or less of that.","startTime":"06:30","endTime":"06:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you have fine brain control over how you view and slice the data.","startTime":"06:40","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So one of the things that we did some data analysis on, which is before back in the old social days, if we had a politics section or category that would largely encapsulate, call it like 95% of all political commentary would be inside of that arena.","startTime":"06:46","endTime":"07:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it was very easy because you could say, oh, turn this off, I just want to see anything more that's political.","startTime":"07:01","endTime":"07:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But now politics is so pervasive and it's everywhere that we're having conversations and it like shows up around, you know, the name of a restaurant or whatever, like things are popping up all over the place.","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so what you have to do and what we do we can do now is essentially every single comment and story that comes in to gig, we can hit a ML pathway that we have to Google that will classify it in 15 different ways.","startTime":"07:17","endTime":"07:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So is it hate speech, is it political, is it this or that?","startTime":"07:32","endTime":"07:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We get back to scores and then we can say okay to the user.","startTime":"07:35","endTime":"07:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you don't want to see political chatter, you don't want to take place out or see the more controversial kind of like topics that are causing a lot of head hate and really anxiety provoking topics, you can kind of slide that slider any way that you want and then immediately that content filters out for you site wide.","startTime":"07:39","endTime":"07:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we want to give users the control of that.","startTime":"07:56","endTime":"07:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Whereas if you are into politics, you can jump into that arena and have fun and, or whatever it is that you do over there, but you can jump into that, but you'll know what you're about to walk into when you do.","startTime":"07:59","endTime":"08:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's more of an opt in.","startTime":"08:10","endTime":"08:11","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We almost think politics in some senses like a almost lightweight, not safer work community these days, you know.","startTime":"08:11","endTime":"08:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, I just wondered how it's going.","startTime":"08:18","endTime":"08:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I guess I read somewhere maybe it was last month that there were 17 communities.","startTime":"08:20","endTime":"08:24","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But again I know this is sort of still invite only.","startTime":"08:24","endTime":"08:27","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I guess what are your learnings so far?","startTime":"08:28","endTime":"08:30","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Has anything surprised you?","startTime":"08:30","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And, and also when are you officially launching so that everybody.","startTime":"08:31","endTime":"08:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, we don't have a hard day, but it's like probably Q1 of next year is when we're really going to go out and so we've got a couple hundred thousand people that are waiting on that wait list to get in and we've been slowly opening that up but we really have a lot of kind of table stakes functionality which is the boring stuff but you just need to have it as a platform.","startTime":"08:34","endTime":"08:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then there's the crazier stuff, which is really kind of what you're seeing here, which is the ability to turn on agents inside of community so you can come in and say hey listen, I have.","startTime":"08:50","endTime":"08:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"My community is for movie fans or my community is for X.","startTime":"09:00","endTime":"09:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, I work and I have a conversation with my agent.","startTime":"09:05","endTime":"09:08","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I want to build custom modules and a custom interface for my community, almost like a replit or a vault for social communities but within those kind of card grids.","startTime":"09:08","endTime":"09:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we want to wake up pleasantly surprised and be like, oh look what somebody deployed.","startTime":"09:16","endTime":"09:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They deployed this new agent that anytime a movie is mentioned automatically when you hover over the rotten tomato scores appear or if it's political in nature, they're automatically going on crawling and hitting the Brave Search API so that we can show know left, middle and right takes on the same topic, you know, all in the same place.","startTime":"09:20","endTime":"09:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so those are like the magical unlocks.","startTime":"09:37","endTime":"09:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you have to build the scaffolding and framework and kind of infrastructure, pull.","startTime":"09:39","endTime":"09:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It off and there's still sort of like, sort of.","startTime":"09:43","endTime":"09:47","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is there a like function?","startTime":"09:49","endTime":"09:51","speaker_name":"speaker

2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we're not doing the time around.","startTime":"09:55","endTime":"09:57","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is a little bit into trouble back in the day, you know I had the first patent for socially liking somebody and getting it back into.","startTime":"09:57","endTime":"10:05","speaker_name":"speaker

1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You are.","startTime":"10:09","endTime":"10:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It was the most valuable thing.","startTime":"10:09","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was funny like the sites will offer next to nothing.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"LinkedIn modeled social patents for millions of dollars because they found that to be their defensible way against the Facebook like and all that.","startTime":"10:13","endTime":"10:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because we had prior.","startTime":"10:20","endTime":"10:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yes, that is the I think was the thing that was brutal about that is it was used in a way to kind of amplify a lot of things that we didn't anticipate.","startTime":"10:22","endTime":"10:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:32","endTime":"10:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We had no idea that we showed you more things than things you like.","startTime":"10:32","endTime":"10:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you're a bad, you know, person that are lean on then you're going to amplify things that can cause a lot of bad things to happen.","startTime":"10:36","endTime":"10:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this version of thing is very much like we're very transparent algorithms.","startTime":"10:43","endTime":"10:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Very much.","startTime":"10:48","endTime":"10:48","speaker_name":"speaker
