## Notes

### **Social Platform Relaunch and Community Monetization**
- The team is relaunching the social platform with a focus on unique community creation and new monetization models by Q1 next year.  
- **The platform will enable users to create custom communities similar to subreddits, launching around January with an initial waitlist of a few hundred thousand users** (01:10)  
    - The goal is not just to copy Reddit but to add novel features unseen elsewhere.  
    - Moderator compensation is a key innovation, addressing the unpaid labor issue seen on Reddit.  
    - Compensation models include equity or direct payments tied to community engagement and revenue flow.  
    - This approach aims to reward moderators proportionally to their community’s size and activity, creating sustainable income streams.  
- **Alexis Ohanian and leadership emphasized user control over communities, allowing migration and ownership of audience data** (02:15)  
    - Users can port their community and audience elsewhere if desired, unlike traditional platforms that lock content in.  
    - This openness reflects a philosophy similar to Substack or Patreon, giving creators more autonomy and long-term value.  
    - The change addresses legal and control issues moderators currently face, such as trademark disputes.  
    - This strategy aims to attract creators seeking greater freedom and reduce platform dependency risks.  
- **The monetization model leans toward a “Netflix-style” subscription system instead of multiple small payments, with transparent revenue sharing visible across communities** (04:05)  
    - Moderators receive attention-based rewards from ad or subscription revenue within their communities.  
    - Even small monthly contributions can aggregate into meaningful income at scale.  
    - This transparency builds trust and engagement by showing how money flows through the ecosystem.  
    - The model supports community growth events and activities funded by shared proceeds.  
### **Content Moderation and User Experience Enhancements**
- A combination of AI tools and community design aims to reduce toxicity and improve user control over content exposure.  
- **The platform targets smaller, trusted micro-communities to foster intimacy and real human connection, reducing large-scale toxicity** (05:35)  
    - This approach counters the broad toxicity seen on platforms like X by limiting interactions to focused groups.  
    - AI-powered moderation helps maintain quality without needing large moderator teams.  
    - Customizable feeds allow users to fine-tune content exposure, such as filtering political or controversial topics.  
    - This opt-in model lets users avoid unwanted content while still engaging where they choose.  
- **Machine learning models classify every piece of content into up to 15 categories, including hate speech and politics, enabling dynamic content filtering for users** (07:05)  
    - Users can adjust sliders to exclude or include specific content types across the platform.  
    - This granular control is a response to the pervasive nature of political content spreading beyond traditional categories.  
    - It improves user experience by letting individuals tailor their feed to personal preferences and mental well-being.  
    - The system supports transparency and user empowerment, contrasting with opaque algorithms on other platforms.  
- **The platform will reintroduce a voting system based on the original “dig” patent, allowing users to influence content visibility with transparent algorithms** (09:30)  
    - This patent underpins social liking but will be applied with controls to prevent amplification of harmful content.  
    - Users can fine-tune algorithmic weighting to see content aligned with their values and interests.  
    - This transparency addresses past issues where algorithms unknowingly promoted divisive or toxic content.  
    - The system aims to restore trust by showing users exactly how their interactions shape their feed.  
### **Product Development and AI Integration Vision**
- The product roadmap includes advanced AI-powered agents that enhance community experiences with customized tools and data integration.  
- **Communities will be able to deploy AI agents to enrich interactions, such as showing movie scores or balanced political viewpoints automatically** (08:30)  
    - These agents create dynamic, interactive experiences tailored to each community’s focus.  
    - Integration with external APIs like Rotten Tomatoes or Brave Search provides real-time, diverse information.  
    - The use of AI agents is a unique feature aimed at differentiation from legacy platforms.  
    - This modular design encourages creativity and user-driven innovation within communities.  
- **The current focus is on building foundational infrastructure and basic platform features before unveiling advanced AI tools in early 2024** (08:50)  
    - The team acknowledges “table stakes” functionality is essential before launching novel features.  
    - Gradual rollout supports stability and quality assurance ahead of full public launch.  
    - Early adopters are part of an invite-only program to refine the experience.  
    - This phased approach balances innovation with reliability to ensure user satisfaction at scale.  
### **Investment Philosophy and Industry Trends**
- True Ventures emphasizes backing founders with bold, unconventional ideas and highlights the evolving role of technology in entrepreneurship.  
- **Founder traits prioritized include a healthy disregard for the impossible and a focus on product design over storytelling alone** (19:00)  
    - This mindset encourages big, bold moves that others might dismiss as risky or impractical.  
    - The firm values raw creativity and resilience more than polished presentations.  
    - This approach supports long-term partnerships based on vision and trust rather than short-term gains.  
    - It fosters innovation that can change markets and create new opportunities.  
- **The software industry’s lowering barriers enable faster product launches with fewer errors, shifting venture capital dynamics** (17:00)  
    - AI tools reduce coding errors dramatically; recent apps launched with only one error in three months.  
    - Entrepreneurs can delay or avoid funding rounds due to easier, cheaper product development.  
    - This shifts VC value toward emotional intelligence and founder support over just capital provision.  
    - VCs who act as trusted, long-term partners will be most sought after by founders.  
- **Hardware investments are approached cautiously, especially AI-powered devices like glasses, due to privacy and social concerns** (12:30)  
    - The team avoids AI hardware that continuously records or invades personal interactions.  
    - Emotional reactions to devices influence investment decisions alongside technical merits.  
    - The focus remains on hardware that respects privacy and social norms.  
    - This stance reflects a broader caution about AI’s potential negative cultural impact.  
### **AI and Cultural Impact Considerations**
- There is deep concern about AI’s influence on privacy, truth, and social behavior, prompting a cautious approach to new technologies.  
- **AI’s constant listening and data logging raise ethical and emotional issues that can harm human interactions** (13:15)  
    - The example of using AI logs in personal arguments shows the potential for misuse.  
    - This impacts trust and willingness to adopt such devices in everyday life.  
    - The team urges careful consideration of AI’s downstream effects on society.  
    - They warn against indiscriminate application of AI as a simple “bolt-on” solution.  
- **The manipulation of digital content, like erasing objects from photos, risks rewriting personal and cultural history** (14:15)  
    - This challenges authenticity and memory, especially for future generations.  
    - The concern is that AI editing might distort reality without clear awareness.  
    - The team hopes to look back critically at these early AI uses as misguided.  
    - They emphasize the need for intentional design that respects truth and history.  
- **Video generation and synthetic media pose unique challenges for children’s perception of reality** (15:20)  
    - Instagram’s Adam Mosseri highlighted children growing up expecting manipulated content as normal.  
    - This creates educational and psychological burdens on families and society.  
    - The team suggests framing such content as “movie magic” to clarify fiction versus reality.  
    - This reflects broader concerns about AI’s long-term cultural impact on trust and understanding.
