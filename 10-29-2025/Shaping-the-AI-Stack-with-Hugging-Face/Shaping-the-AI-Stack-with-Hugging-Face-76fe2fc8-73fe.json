this is going to be a continuing trend I think for the all is my.","startTime":"01:11","endTime":"01:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There is a revival on the summer of open source both in the US as a reaction to China, to the US act a lot of open source we saw a bunch of very large companies bring open source back in the U.S. the underlying danger we see is that a lot of the startup who want to do something different from what they can do with close system have to start with and it's a wide trend which is if you want to experiment with a new use case in AI you need to start with open source because usually you don't fit in the box of what the closest model can do.","startTime":"01:20","endTime":"01:56","speaker_name":"speaker

this idea that you need to build massive models.","startTime":"03:13","endTime":"03:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Companies like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic are trying to

here.","startTime":"03:39","endTime":"03:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think that they work really well.","startTime":"03:45","endTime":"03:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it's also pretty obvious to anyone who is training them or can involve that.","startTime":"03:47","endTime":"03:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they generalize quite less than we thought they would

play.","startTime":"03:55","endTime":"04:11","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so this means we have two things for us it means that first we'll keep seeing companies like

basically annotation and this type of very like slow extension of frontier won't really work.","startTime":"04:51","endTime":"04:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So so the

theory.","startTime":"05:03","endTime":"05:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yeah, science I think has two possibilities.","startTime":"05:07","endTime":"05:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One is very real and I think will really work, which is this very useful scientist like

2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Uncommon, going to work really well.","startTime":"05:26","endTime":"05:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And probably start with AI research itself, say, okay, I want to explore architecture, just explore.","startTime":"05:27","endTime":"05:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then the most interesting part I think would be this AI scientist which is able to define the project itself and define your project is usually in real research, not just about looking for the next input, but kind of looking about.","startTime":"05:34","endTime":"05:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We were talking just before about this ethereal idea that you should look for something which is true and try to prove that it's false.","startTime":"05:48","endTime":"05:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's where you can create really great

that the sun orbits around the Earth and you should find a way to prove that it's wrong.","startTime":"06:05","endTime":"06:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And a lot of great research has been done this way, which is taking something that looks really obvious, kind of proving that this was wrong or that maybe it could be reused in a totally different

earlier this year basically saying something to this effect of how, you know, we're training AI models to act like an army of yes men, but they can't ask good

that.","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So still feel that way?","startTime":"06:48","endTime":"06:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes, I feel that way for sure.","startTime":"06:50","endTime":"06:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that's.","startTime":"06:53","endTime":"06:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's very frustrating in a way because we all kind of want this AI and yeah, systems are great

2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we all would like AI that kind office as a sol them or to do some, you know, really like breakthrough discoveries, for instance.","startTime":"07:02","endTime":"07:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I don't think we're really on track for that right now.","startTime":"07:15","endTime":"07:18","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there is this idea that maybe if you just let them reason enough and think enough about the

even.","startTime":"07:27","endTime":"07:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, that is, you know, a controversial take in Silicon Valley

that we're going to keep scaling to get more intelligent models, to get, you know, super intelligence.","startTime":"07:34","endTime":"07:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I guess my question is, you know, given your reservations about that, what do you think about the AI?","startTime":"07:45","endTime":"07:51","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Definitely.","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One good example I think is math.","startTime":"07:54","endTime":"07:57","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I Think a lot of noise recently was around this new proof in math and how this is actually scientific discoveries.","startTime":"07:57","endTime":"08:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think that's very wrong because real discovery math is not writing the truth,

mathematician with deemed worth exploring.","startTime":"08:13","endTime":"08:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because some of these hypothesis of arbitrary math, basically then people are ready to spend years on their life trying to prove they are true.","startTime":"08:21","endTime":"08:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have to come up with this level of convention.","startTime":"08:32","endTime":"08:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think you say that AI is actually bringing something to the table research.","startTime":"08:35","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so you see this thing where we say okay, AI found a new way to improve this even more recently.","startTime":"08:41","endTime":"08:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just actually was just used as a good way to search in the literature for how to improve something.","startTime":"08:47","endTime":"08:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then people then have some very bad to write the valuation of your company as an AI discovery.","startTime":"08:54","endTime":"09:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So do you think that like that means that the valuations of some of these companies don't make sense?","startTime":"09:08","endTime":"09:12","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"09:14","endTime":"09:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean I think the bubble talk is like really at a peak right now.","startTime":"09:17","endTime":"09:21","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like I think Jeff Bezos said the other day, we're in a bubble, you know, and I'm curious, like do you think that's related to.","startTime":"09:21","endTime":"09:27","speaker_name":"speaker

2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's why I don't really want to pump this bubble because maybe just putting enough money in this way I can bring something interesting.","startTime":"09:33","endTime":"09:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let's take another example.","startTime":"09:46","endTime":"09:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like periodic labs is really interesting, I think.","startTime":"09:47","endTime":"09:49","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so they want to do a lot around to try this out because the whole thing is you want to have some idea of experimental test, then you want to find a way to test them to kind of close the loop your kind of RL in real life.","startTime":"09:50","endTime":"10:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But doing real life experiments is really annoying and hard because you go in hardware, you're

annoying.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's very slow.","startTime":"10:12","endTime":"10:12","speaker_name":"speaker

want.","startTime":"10:14","endTime":"10:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the shortcut is you just do simulation.","startTime":"10:15","endTime":"10:18","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You try to simulate a lot.","startTime":"10:18","endTime":"10:19","speaker_name":"speaker

know that it's usually the main problem is life doesn't behave like your simulation in any case.","startTime":"10:23","endTime":"10:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So actually you're not.","startTime":"10:30","endTime":"10:31","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I guess we all kind of know that there's this big question, right?","startTime":"10:32","endTime":"10:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like is simulation going to work?","startTime":"10:35","endTime":"10:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because we have to simulate real world, the world.","startTime":"10:37","endTime":"10:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we know it's really hard to simulate.","startTime":"10:39","endTime":"10:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's not all out of the Box by AI.","startTime":"10:40","endTime":"10:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But maybe if you look like money, we can still, you know, as a side effect can improve the level of the precision of the quality of our simulation environment.","startTime":"10:43","endTime":"10:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We kind of escape by the top by, you know, fixing the side problem using the fact that in AI we can raise a lot of money.","startTime":"10:54","endTime":"11:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's another side thing about that, which is if you make GPU extremely good and cheap and much more like we are doing with AI, the same GPU arms the same thing we use for scientific simulation.","startTime":"11:03","endTime":"11:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So maybe at the side all the things that all the fields that rely on simulation, including science, but also engineering that spaces is used, maybe all of this is something we improve as well.","startTime":"11:15","endTime":"11:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We may reach another level where actually we can get this guidance.","startTime":"11:26","endTime":"11:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:31","endTime":"11:31","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think one interesting thing about a lot of these AI companies at the forefront is that they're building these very expensive closed models.","startTime":"11:33","endTime":"11:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But on your platform you can download open models that can do a lot of the same kind of work.","startTime":"11:45","endTime":"11:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm curious, we've seen Meta pull back a little bit from open source.","startTime":"11:52","endTime":"11:58","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"OpenAI released an open model in the last year, but the quality was not quite at the level of its time, top tier models.","startTime":"11:58","endTime":"12:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm curious what you make of, you know, how open source can keep up with the closed risk in the coming year.","startTime":"12:07","endTime":"12:16","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's a complicated question because the decision to open source model in a company come from many factors and not all of them are just like open source is often used also in the whole context of the life cycle of labs.","startTime":"12:16","endTime":"12:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you want to hire people.","startTime":"12:34","endTime":"12:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So one of the main reasons Meta kind of, I think wants a bit less is getting a bit hard to hire good people when you want in the west to in the US when you want to have them to work on open source projects.","startTime":"12:35","endTime":"12:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There is kind of, there has been like, I would say over the past year kind of a higher attractiveness of making insights, making something private and closed versus making something in the open.","startTime":"12:48","endTime":"13:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which is interesting because in China it's the exact opposite.","startTime":"13:01","endTime":"13:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you have a closed source lab, it's very hard to hire, it's very experienced.","startTime":"13:05","endTime":"13:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so all of these factors are not exactly.","startTime":"13:10","endTime":"13:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I would say they're also just kind of almost social, cultural factor about how to get the best AI centers to work at your place.","startTime":"13:12","endTime":"13:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think if a couple of really good labs start to be open source at the frontier level today in the US it might very well be that actually now to hire really good people now need to be open source because kind of that's a cool thing.","startTime":"13:20","endTime":"13:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So these things are really hard to predict.","startTime":"13:34","endTime":"13:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So let's say reflection for instance work really well.","startTime":"13:37","endTime":"13:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Open source is amazing, super impressive

the.","startTime":"13:41","endTime":"13:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I mean what do you think that should be done to encourage more companies to open source their models?","startTime":"13:47","endTime":"13:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like for example the Trump administration just put out a bunch of executive orders, some of it

efforts?","startTime":"14:01","endTime":"14:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it's very important really pragmatically A lot of the startup research ecosystem is

not let another country take the deal.","startTime":"14:42","endTime":"14:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It should be the US that have a full stack just like we want the

1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The chips on the level next, just next above the chips and actually very close I think so all these things should be able to be dealing

amazing.","startTime":"15:27","endTime":"15:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think they're the top open source AI models data sets, organizational, the hub.","startTime":"15:29","endTime":"15:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Not a lot of people know about that.","startTime":"15:34","endTime":"15:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think Jensen is very smart.","startTime":"15:35","endTime":"15:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just like he understood that to get adoption for chips he needed to have a very good software 1.0 ecosystem.","startTime":"15:38","endTime":"15:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think he already has understood which is all the AI model.","startTime":"15:46","endTime":"15:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think there's still a lot of labs here I think who are very close to frontier.","startTime":"15:54","endTime":"15:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you see for Jensen the main problem is this customer also training model themselves so it cannot really directly compete with them.","startTime":"15:59","endTime":"16:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if they want very close to the top level or the top one level of performance right out the box.","startTime":"16:04","endTime":"16:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean the main question I think very longer term maybe is if this kind of a race become very intense that we start talking about more like nationalizing that will be I think maybe one question where open source Will have to be considered.","startTime":"16:19","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But other than that, if we stay more in like liberal capitalism type of thing, I think open source is really the best way.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"16:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What's your thing about nationalize that be could.","startTime":"16:48","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it's one of these cases.","startTime":"16:51","endTime":"16:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think depends more on.","startTime":"16:53","endTime":"16:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not predict in a data driven way.","startTime":"16:54","endTime":"16:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Depends more on a couple of key people and relation policy balancing all around the world.","startTime":"16:59","endTime":"17:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm quite pragmatic so I tend to say.","startTime":"17:08","endTime":"17:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I tend to think that this is mostly an extension of past compute technology past the assistance and for the same reason I don't really believe in like this explosion like I was saying of intelligence.","startTime":"17:10","endTime":"17:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think we just have this steady increase and as long as the technologies increase steadily pass it should be fine.","startTime":"17:25","endTime":"17:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It should not fall too much.","startTime":"17:33","endTime":"17:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"17:37","endTime":"17:38","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I mean it is quite political.","startTime":"17:38","endTime":"17:41","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I also do want to talk about this business a little bit more.","startTime":"17:42","endTime":"17:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You mentioned Nvidia, which I believe is an investor.","startTime":"17:48","endTime":"17:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The last round you guys raised was in 2023.","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"17:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It was over $200 million, close to a $5 billion valuation.","startTime":"17:55","endTime":"17:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Are you guys looking to raise again anytime soon?","startTime":"17:59","endTime":"18:01","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We don't really need to.","startTime":"18:02","endTime":"18:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this last round we haven't even touched.","startTime":"18:04","endTime":"18:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're going to.","startTime":"18:07","endTime":"18:08","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's kind of feel very old school in this world right now.","startTime":"18:11","endTime":"18:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I feel that we just very careful about how much we spend our Runway we still very small team 250 which is quite small for 8 years old company.","startTime":"18:14","endTime":"18:24","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we used it a little bit when we did a couple of acquisitions.","startTime":"18:24","endTime":"18:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're very careful about that.","startTime":"18:28","endTime":"18:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we match rays I would say but that would be more like okay, let's say we want to have secondary actors.","startTime":"18:29","endTime":"18:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well this type of question are maybe more than four real legs into.","startTime":"18:35","endTime":"18:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I mean you mentioned before that hugging face is profitable.","startTime":"18:41","endTime":"18:45","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm curious, you know, what does the business of hugging face look like today?","startTime":"18:46","endTime":"18:50","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"A lot of people download models for free from Hugging Face.","startTime":"18:50","endTime":"18:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But you know, how are you guys doing revenue and you know what's that look like?","startTime":"18:53","endTime":"18:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We're trying positioning a bit so.","startTime":"18:59","endTime":"19:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we used to have a revenue mostly based on consulting and a couple of really big partnerships that we had with most of the cloud providers, for instance with large partnership and we started last year with enterprise version of the hub.","startTime":"19:01","endTime":"19:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what we see is in the new AI model economy, a lot of people, a lot of teams now start to train their own models and have kind of a decent activity in terms of training fine tuning data about that and kind of reflecting the activity There is in code and so what we studied is the enterprise version of the hub.","startTime":"19:15","endTime":"19:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So for this company we're very active on the hub, not only for external exposition and externally sharing model, but also internally hosting model that they want to share between teams.","startTime":"19:33","endTime":"19:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They can move to the enterprise version, the hub where you have like security on who can access models, resource groups.","startTime":"19:43","endTime":"19:49","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A lot of labs basically have all this, you know, very like business level and pollution level, safety and security you would like to have as well as colleagues.","startTime":"19:49","endTime":"19:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is working really well.","startTime":"20:00","endTime":"20:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We we have a couple thousand organization that including organization like Salesforce and so I think as follow we want to keep building as the I would say the community around AI mature and people are not only consuming AI but become kind of AI builder more and more.","startTime":"20:01","endTime":"20:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You think this is kind of a long term really large project and one.","startTime":"20:20","endTime":"20:24","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Of the most recent ventures you guys have is you acquired a humanoid robotic startup and you've actually also launched one of your robots.","startTime":"20:24","endTime":"20:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Riichi, tell me about robot and why hugging face is getting into robot.","startTime":"20:35","endTime":"20:39","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would say at core the goal we have is to build this very large open source.","startTime":"20:40","endTime":"20:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We think in every field that AI is touching right now there should be an open source library.","startTime":"20:47","endTime":"20:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it started with LLM, it's extended, maybe stable diffusion for instance, first vision and then speech.","startTime":"20:52","endTime":"20:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We think that I'm very much convinced that the coming one or two years will be here where AI is going to move to work.","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's going to be one of the areas where we can make exponential corporate.","startTime":"21:07","endTime":"21:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And when we studied robot activity which is active quite some time ago now, close to two years ago, the main act of their work was Tesla was figure doing amazing robots.","startTime":"21:14","endTime":"21:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But really it's like this vertical style of closed source, right?","startTime":"21:26","endTime":"21:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I don't think you can really take or you will be able to take an optimus robot and adapt it to whatever new idea you have.","startTime":"21:29","endTime":"21:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it kind of reproduced in my mind.","startTime":"21:36","endTime":"21:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The situation happened just after GPT3 where you had a bunch of new startups like Cohere AI21 that were being started, but none of them really wanted to push any offices.","startTime":"21:41","endTime":"21:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the same happened in robotics, right?","startTime":"21:52","endTime":"21:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It becomes like a key technology and there is nothing that you can really see as a community.","startTime":"21:54","endTime":"22:00","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we decided to start that on the software side.","startTime":"22:00","endTime":"22:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We started a library called the Robots try to see if we can bring people on the Hub.","startTime":"22:03","endTime":"22:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1}]
