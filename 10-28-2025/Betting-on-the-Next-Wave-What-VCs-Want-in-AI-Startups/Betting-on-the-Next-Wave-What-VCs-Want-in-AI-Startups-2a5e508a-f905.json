looking at a lot of AI neighbors and security in each AI I think is going.","startTime":"21:04","endTime":"21:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To be really important.","startTime":"21:09","endTime":"21:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's going to be whole new like I think initiatives that basically because the products
