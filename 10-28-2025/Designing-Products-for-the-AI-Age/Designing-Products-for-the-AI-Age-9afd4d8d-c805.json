beginning.","startTime":"03:05","endTime":"03:14","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So it's been interesting for us to bring AI into that equation.","startTime":"03:14","endTime":"03:17","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And how do we take AI, which is often this very single player experience in many tools, into experience that makes it feel like AI is just yet another company.","startTime":"03:17","endTime":"03:26","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's kind of our aspiration as we've been building, you know, a lot of our capabilities.","startTime":"03:27","endTime":"03:31","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Same question for you, Zach.","startTime":"03:33","endTime":"03:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so we, you know, went through a bunch of iterations figuring out the right way to put AI into warp.","startTime":"03:35","endTime":"03:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We did a thing initially, I think a lot of companies did.","startTime":"03:42","endTime":"03:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We put a chat panel in and then we realized actually that integration

computer.","startTime":"03:50","endTime":"03:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the more like native, we've been able to make the AI feel like we got rid of that tap

2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The more natural the interaction has been.","startTime":"04:06","endTime":"04:08","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think the key thing for us has been like, what's the most native way to get the AI into the workflow in our app?","startTime":"04:08","endTime":"04:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's been a big unlock.","startTime":"04:17","endTime":"04:18","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Great.","startTime":"04:19","endTime":"04:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Back to Yuki.","startTime":"04:21","endTime":"04:22","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think one trippy thing that I think about is like your team goes into work and fires up figma to load the next version of figma that uses figma to build figma and figma.","startTime":"04:22","endTime":"04:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Maybe just talk about what it's like, your internal adoption of figma products and how your team has changed as you push the limits of creativity in figma.","startTime":"04:33","endTime":"04:42","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Totally.","startTime":"04:42","endTime":"04:42","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And what's that like?","startTime":"04:42","endTime":"04:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean it's kind of like inception in a way where we're like, what are we looking at?","startTime":"04:43","endTime":"04:47","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Can you get rid of the other chrome so we can see just the design of figma outside of, without seeing the rest of figma really confusing.","startTime":"04:48","endTime":"04:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But you know, I mean we're, we live and breathe Figma every single day.","startTime":"04:58","endTime":"05:02","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And when I first arrived actually back in 2019, you know, we had this issue where my product managers were not using figma that much, right?","startTime":"05:02","endTime":"05:10","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"They're reviewing designs, doing all the PM things, but they weren't in it every single day.","startTime":"05:10","endTime":"05:15","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think it's really important to be in your product every single day to really kind of, you know, build intuition, have a sense of quality.","startTime":"05:15","endTime":"05:21","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so, you know, were a very doc driven culture and we forced them to be a deck driven culture just so that they could be building decks in figma.","startTime":"05:22","endTime":"05:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And now, you know, over time people are using it organically because we built a lot of tools for product managers and non designers like hdm, Sigma, Slides, Nick now.","startTime":"05:30","endTime":"05:40","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you know, it's made it a lot easier for people to have a bit more of an intuitive sense or feel connected to what they're building.","startTime":"05:41","endTime":"05:47","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Figma.","startTime":"05:47","endTime":"05:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Are, are people adopting the AI parts of figma internally to build figma?","startTime":"05:49","endTime":"05:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, you know, we're trying to kind of, you know, we are, we have a lot of FIGMA make prototypes of figma make.","startTime":"05:54","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think in today's world with prototype, with AI, you actually need to prototype with AI like an actual LLM to know what's possible, right?","startTime":"06:02","endTime":"06:12","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"As the prototypes are more important than ever before.","startTime":"06:12","endTime":"06:14","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And for that, you know, we use Big O make and.","startTime":"06:14","endTime":"06:18","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Was there any like change resistance or like stuff you had to do to get people to use it?","startTime":"06:21","endTime":"06:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I asked if it warp.","startTime":"06:26","endTime":"06:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was at least initially challenging to get at least some of the more.","startTime":"06:27","endTime":"06:31","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Senior and more experienced people on the.","startTime":"06:31","endTime":"06:32","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Team to change their workload and be more AI first.","startTime":"06:32","endTime":"06:36","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean I think there are two kind of areas, right?","startTime":"06:37","endTime":"06:39","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"One is changing your workflow and for that, you know, and I'm not sure what the work equivalent would be, but for Figma design there are a lot of designers who want to code or who are dangerous enough to code some things but can't do everything.","startTime":"06:39","endTime":"06:53","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And for them having this power of coding all of a sudden is really amazing.","startTime":"06:54","endTime":"06:58","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And whether that's for three figure make, whether that's your work and so just kind of really pushing on that piece and getting people excited about that new capability.","startTime":"06:59","endTime":"07:07","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then the other Thing that was probably kind of a bit of attention is designers are very used to building the prototypes themselves and doing the designs themselves.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:16","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And all of a sudden you have a lot of other people kind of contributing to that process.","startTime":"07:16","endTime":"07:20","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And while Figma has always been welcoming of that and blurring those boundaries, it's still a little bit kind of like strange when a PM shows up with a prototype of exactly what they were thinking of.","startTime":"07:20","endTime":"07:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think that's something that culturally we just have to embrace a little bit more and say, okay, well what can designers do in that world where everyone's creating, what are the Rails that they can create?","startTime":"07:31","endTime":"07:40","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The creative infrastructure of design systems that they can invest in so that everyone can create high quality stuff.","startTime":"07:40","endTime":"07:46","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What's it like building Warp?","startTime":"07:47","endTime":"07:48","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"With Warp, it's, I mean, it's cool.","startTime":"07:48","endTime":"07:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a huge productivity boost for the most part.","startTime":"07:52","endTime":"07:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But like I was saying to Yuki, so it was actually, at least at the beginning, a little bit challenging to get the more senior developers on the team to adopt a new workflow.","startTime":"07:55","endTime":"08:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like, obviously there's a popularity of Vibe coding tools and like, I think a big part of the draw is like, if you're not a developer, you can build code, right?","startTime":"08:05","endTime":"08:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can write code, you can build apps.","startTime":"08:16","endTime":"08:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For the senior developers on the team, it's like they know how to do it.","startTime":"08:17","endTime":"08:22","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's not like a zero to one, it's more of like, how do It faster?","startTime":"08:22","endTime":"08:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we actually had to put in place a sort of mandate approach where every task within Warp should start with a prompt, doesn't necessarily need to finish with a prompt and doing that, obviously it's great for dog food feedback, that type of thing.","startTime":"08:26","endTime":"08:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we've gotten to a point now where it's interesting.","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The more senior developers who are more reticent at first are now, I think, the most eager adopters and also the most skilled at actually guiding the agents to do coding tasks and sort of setting the new standard across the team for how you should work with the tool.","startTime":"08:46","endTime":"09:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's been cool.","startTime":"09:02","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Even in just like three to six months here, it's really changed internally.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:08","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I remember.","startTime":"09:08","endTime":"09:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, Zach's written a lot on the Internet about product
