the.","startTime":"02:42","endTime":"02:43","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Pandemic or something else that just solidified this idea that robotics were going to make inroads

like were getting a lot more inbound, even if we had to go out on like, in fact, some of our early customers, like you alluded to, essentially convinced us that we should do this.","startTime":"03:01","endTime":"03:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, were actually at the time really focused on like ghost kitchens and fast

happening.","startTime":"03:17","endTime":"03:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because of course, pre Covid, but like, what was happening is that consumers, you and I were getting doordash and grease delivered to us.","startTime":"03:19","endTime":"03:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so companies like cloud kitchens, which I was helenake

robots who were like, aha, we're gonna make robots for these ghost kitchens and back of house.","startTime":"03:32","endTime":"03:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then what happened is that, you know, that's great market.","startTime":"03:40","endTime":"03:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then some of these, like really big food

manual.","startTime":"03:54","endTime":"03:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like, because of the pandemic, they're like, hey, we need some automation.","startTime":"03:56","endTime":"04:00","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And they essentially convinced us that we should do that, which is a great sign.","startTime":"04:00","endTime":"04:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I want to stick with you a little bit more.","startTime":"04:04","endTime":"04:07","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You're obviously using AI as a core feature of your product, but were you using it as you iterated to develop product market fit?","startTime":"04:08","endTime":"04:16","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think for us, like robotics and AI kind of are essentially one of the same.","startTime":"04:16","endTime":"04:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There is a lot of traditional automation that exists.","startTime":"04:21","endTime":"04:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's kind of the robots you'd see in the Ford factory 40 years ago, 30 years

good.","startTime":"04:41","endTime":"04:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In, let's say, manufacturing lines where this line is making AirPods all day

mix.","startTime":"04:51","endTime":"04:52","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One line, that's one product, you just run it all day long.","startTime":"04:52","endTime":"04:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where AI has kind of really revolutionized robotics is saying, okay, well now I want to be able to take that robot and now I want to be able to make lots of different products with or for example of a horse with humanoids down the line, right.","startTime":"04:55","endTime":"05:07","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Be able to go home and do lots of different tasks.","startTime":"05:07","endTime":"05:09","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think for us, like the nature of food is it's organic, right?","startTime":"05:09","endTime":"05:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like diced chicken is not diced chicken.","startTime":"05:14","endTime":"05:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not diced chicken.","startTime":"05:15","endTime":"05:16","speaker_name":"speaker

different than a sauce is very different than whatever.","startTime":"05:18","endTime":"05:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think the inherent organic nature of food necessitated AI for us.","startTime":"05:22","endTime":"05:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think the modern kind of robotics company is like, it's essentially one of the same.","startTime":"05:26","endTime":"05:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like the hardware for us at least is actually mushy, off the shelf.","startTime":"05:31","endTime":"05:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We buy it from a bunch of different suppliers all over the world.","startTime":"05:36","endTime":"05:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you were to visit our office, most of the team is AI Robotics alterations focus on making this hardware platform flexible.","startTime":"05:39","endTime":"05:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"05:46","endTime":"05:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now, Ian and Merlee, like Rajat here, has pretty clear, I guess, goals defined, right.","startTime":"05:47","endTime":"05:54","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"When he reaches those, he knows he's got product market fit.","startTime":"05:54","endTime":"05:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The customers are happy the going to.","startTime":"05:57","endTime":"05:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Pay on the contract and adopt this

right?","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:03","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because like AI can be flexible and.","startTime":"06:03","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It can address many different things.","startTime":"06:05","endTime":"06:06","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"How do you know in that case when you've achieved it?","startTime":"06:07","endTime":"06:10","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Is there like a favorite metric that you're using?","startTime":"06:10","endTime":"06:12","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think, you know, across the board every business is different.","startTime":"06:14","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think it's, you know, really challenging to also subscribe to a blanket across every company.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:23","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"However, I think something that we look for across the board in terms of what are the best indicators of product market fit are thinking through the velocity at which you're kind of adding platforms.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:34","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so thinking about, hey, is it really easy or is the friction in terms of being able to sell your product getting faster and faster, which is obviously increasing sales cycles and kind of related to that is the friction point at which you were able to add these business, adding customers or businesses to your product or your platform accelerating, and that usually indicates to us that, hey, not only is there a market push, but there's actually a market pull in terms of your product, which is a really great indicator or leading indicator of product market Fit in terms of what we see.","startTime":"06:34","endTime":"07:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then also similarly when you think about how that evolves in terms of your overall growth, but really looking at how you're able to land, you know, larger kind of accounts or larger businesses or larger enterprises and more sophisticated, that obviously are some of the interesting indicators that we look for.","startTime":"07:03","endTime":"07:19","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think the other dimension that we also looked at is utilization engagement, which is especially in the world of AI, oftentimes we talked about the whole experimentational budget thinking through how frequently are your products being utilized as like a end customer even within an organization.","startTime":"07:19","endTime":"07:35","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's obviously consumer metrics like the down to Mao wow ratios that we look at, but also thinking through within an enterprise, how frequently are your end users or your customers actually engaging with the tool and the product that they are, you know, paying for, you know, and sometimes the order of eight figure seven figures, you know, potentially and really understanding how sticky is that.","startTime":"07:35","endTime":"07:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think fundamentally those are some of the indicators that we look at that are quantitative that may be a little bit more not so obvious than maybe the overall ARR growth or revenue growth that you see in your business.","startTime":"07:56","endTime":"08:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"By the way, pro tip, go look at Iconx benchmarking data, which is out there.","startTime":"08:06","endTime":"08:11","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's some of the best data points around software companies, especially in the early.","startTime":"08:11","endTime":"08:16","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That's why I looked at morale for the.","startTime":"08:19","endTime":"08:21","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I guess I know, you know, because you have all the data anyway, it's actually great that information is power when you're building your company.","startTime":"08:22","endTime":"08:27","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so go look at those metrics to see what best in class companies look like.","startTime":"08:27","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"By the time they get to the series B and series C, you have a lot more data to work with, right?","startTime":"08:31","endTime":"08:36","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Especially financial data and product metrics.","startTime":"08:36","endTime":"08:38","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Earlier stages are a little bit trickier.","startTime":"08:38","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So maybe I'll speak to that because you know, at Those formative like 0 to 1, 1 to 10 stages, the data can oftentimes be misleading.","startTime":"08:40","endTime":"08:48","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"If you get a huge spike, is that hype or is that real product market fit?","startTime":"08:48","endTime":"08:53","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"08:53","endTime":"08:53","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Sometimes not enough data can be misleading too.","startTime":"08:54","endTime":"08:56","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like nobody really wanted to back Uber early, going back to the Uber example, right?","startTime":"08:56","endTime":"09:00","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But then investors realized they were wrong.","startTime":"09:00","endTime":"09:02","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So there's a couple things that I look for that really matter at the early stages.","startTime":"09:02","endTime":"09:07","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Seed series A to identify breakout companies.","startTime":"09:07","endTime":"09:10","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"One is to the extent, I mean obviously the product velocity of the team itself.","startTime":"09:10","endTime":"09:16","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"How quickly are you shipping features in new product iterations?","startTime":"09:16","endTime":"09:20","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It should be happening weekly or maybe even multiple times a week.","startTime":"09:20","endTime":"09:23","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You have to ship really fast to develop any serious PMF2 is obviously you want to see user growth and engagement and ultimately retention and minimal sort of churn in your user base.","startTime":"09:23","endTime":"09:36","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But the fanaticism of that early user base really matters.","startTime":"09:36","endTime":"09:40","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Are there people who are just like, hooked on the product?","startTime":"09:40","endTime":"09:43","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Are there people who would be asking, will say, like, I can't live without this product.","startTime":"09:43","endTime":"09:47","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Be so sad if it didn't exist tomorrow.","startTime":"09:47","endTime":"09:49","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, the fanaticism of the early user base is a really important indicator.","startTime":"09:49","endTime":"09:53","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And third is, you know, really, you know, are you sort of a nice to have or a must have?","startTime":"09:54","endTime":"10:02","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:02","endTime":"10:03","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And that can exist in different categories.","startTime":"10:04","endTime":"10:06","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Entertainment is kind of a must have.","startTime":"10:06","endTime":"10:08","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, it seems to be discretionary.","startTime":"10:08","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But the reality is people will spend hours a day watching, you know, content or obviously playing a game.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:17","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So it can exist in any category.","startTime":"10:17","endTime":"10:19","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But having that sort of like, have you earned the right to be on someone's home, like, page or on their phone or in their daily lives?","startTime":"10:19","endTime":"10:28","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And I think if you talk to customers or users, even in qualitative interviews, which we do tend to do a lot early on, that comes through very clearly.","startTime":"10:28","endTime":"10:36","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, I just want to say we're going to be taking questions.","startTime":"10:36","endTime":"10:39","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We have two mics, one in each aisle.","startTime":"10:39","endTime":"10:42","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So if you have a question, feel free to line up, line those, and we'll start addressing those after this next one, which is how do you know, there are obviously two different paths you can go.","startTime":"10:42","endTime":"10:52","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You can get the qualitative data, you can get the quantitative data on product market fit.","startTime":"10:52","endTime":"10:56","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"How do you balance that?","startTime":"10:56","endTime":"10:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Well, I think with your earlier stages, you.","startTime":"11:00","endTime":"11:02","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You have to look at a combination of both.","startTime":"11:02","endTime":"11:04","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You know, the reality is we make those early kind of investment decisions with imperfect information.","startTime":"11:04","endTime":"11:09","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But, you know, another key data point that I think about a lot is kind of founder idea fit or founder market fit.","startTime":"11:10","endTime":"11:19","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"11:19","endTime":"11:19","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Why does this particular team have an unfair advantage to win in building this exact company, this exact business?","startTime":"11:19","endTime":"11:28","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And that requires getting to know the team.","startTime":"11:28","endTime":"11:30","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And a lot of it is also about their technical depth and ability to sort of construct a product that will fit their vision.","startTime":"11:30","endTime":"11:39","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So I don't know that I have an easy answer to that other than that's the job is to make decisions with imperfect information.","startTime":"11:39","endTime":"11:46","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, I couldn't agree more.","startTime":"11:46","endTime":"11:47","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just want to underscore what Ann alluded to just now, which is that founder market fit and having domain expertise can really compound in a beautiful way.","startTime":"11:48","endTime":"11:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it really benefits in terms of having insights or knowledge, in terms of understanding a vertical or understanding a market in a way that maybe the rest of the world doesn't see it today and really driving that kind of market pull.","startTime":"11:56","endTime":"12:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we've been fortunate to partner with like 2es procore, who lived in construction for many years when he was.","startTime":"12:06","endTime":"12:12","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"At the age of 16 and putting.","startTime":"12:12","endTime":"12:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Up like wi fi pools in construction sites and like really understanding how project management works in construction to enable him to build a legendary construction software business or same with like ARA via service titan.","startTime":"12:13","endTime":"12:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so seeing those journeys we've seen been fortunate to like see that manifest pretty tangibly.","startTime":"12:25","endTime":"12:29","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And St. Anne's comment earlier, like, fundamentally we are partnering with you as entrepreneurs and founders and understanding, you know, how you kind of adapt in variable environments and thinking through that.","startTime":"12:29","endTime":"12:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so that is like first and foremost, probably the most important that I.","startTime":"12:40","endTime":"12:43","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Would say, I would probably say that.","startTime":"12:43","endTime":"12:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You agree with that like across the board in terms of who you partner with and doing that qualitative work in terms of understanding the voice of the customer and marrying that with the data points that we kind of talked about, whether it's like your ACVs, your growth or the metrics of the retention, et cetera, and actually seeing how those two are either connected or disconnected.","startTime":"12:44","endTime":"13:03","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I think it's always a bit of both.","startTime":"13:03","endTime":"13:05","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Roger, did you have any qualitative feedback process?","startTime":"13:06","endTime":"13:12","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think Merlin had a really good point about motivation is actually like, especially for enterprise, like really key metric, but in the early days, especially for robotics, but I think really for any like deep tech kind of company, that's very hard, right?","startTime":"13:12","endTime":"13:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Your product's probably not going to work totally well.","startTime":"13:27","endTime":"13:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like when we first shipped to our customers, I mean the thing would break very frequently.","startTime":"13:29","endTime":"13:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Software, right?","startTime":"13:34","endTime":"13:35","speaker_name":"speaker

2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Lots of issues, right?","startTime":"13:40","endTime":"13:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so if you look at our utilization, if you look at our uptime or whatever, these kind of core metrics, it's like pretty bad.","startTime":"13:42","endTime":"13:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's pretty good.","startTime":"13:48","endTime":"13:49","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Why are we even doing this?","startTime":"13:49","endTime":"13:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"13:50","endTime":"13:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then our customers were like, no, come back tomorrow, fix it.","startTime":"13:51","endTime":"13:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we really want this.","startTime":"13:55","endTime":"13:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we failed for like months at a time.","startTime":"13:56","endTime":"13:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's a really technically intense problem, right?","startTime":"13:58","endTime":"14:00","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not because it's just really hard, right?","startTime":"14:01","endTime":"14:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But our customers were like, very patient.","startTime":"14:04","endTime":"14:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like we would fail production, they would have to stop production hours and they would be like, okay, come back tomorrow, try it again, come back tomorrow, try it again.","startTime":"14:06","endTime":"14:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think it was just like, that's what honesty kept us going.","startTime":"14:13","endTime":"14:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There was even the team was like, we're just failing.","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"14:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, why are we, like, we're at the physical limits, like, why are we even here?","startTime":"14:19","endTime":"14:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"14:22","endTime":"14:22","speaker_name":"speaker

this.","startTime":"14:24","endTime":"14:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Figure it out.","startTime":"14:26","endTime":"14:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's very motivating.","startTime":"14:27","endTime":"14:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean, that's what honestly allowed me to like, not give up, which is like customers deeply.","startTime":"14:28","endTime":"14:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All right, I think we have a question over here.","startTime":"14:34","endTime":"14:35","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Morning guys.","startTime":"14:38","endTime":"14:38","speaker_name":"speaker

years on pricing.","startTime":"14:40","endTime":"14:43","speaker_name":"speaker 6","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And my experience is a lot of companies have the right product market fit, but not the right price point market fit.","startTime":"14:43","endTime":"14:49","speaker_name":"speaker 6","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So it's a great product, but people don't seem to pay enough for it or not at all.","startTime":"14:50","endTime":"14:55","speaker_name":"speaker 6","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"What's your experience?","startTime":"14:55","endTime":"14:56","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is that often too late in the product development stage that you look at those questions?","startTime":"14:56","endTime":"15:01","speaker_name":"speaker 6","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Willingness to take.","startTime":"15:01","endTime":"15:02","speaker_name":"speaker 6","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I can take this one.","startTime":"15:04","endTime":"15:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think this is actually like very like foundational to our business.","startTime":"15:04","endTime":"15:08","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like in automation, like what's very like pricing and model I think is kind of related.","startTime":"15:08","endTime":"15:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like a lot of our customers are used to capex, like they're used to buying a piece of equipment, right.","startTime":"15:13","endTime":"15:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we really wanted to have this like recurring model, right, because it's more of a software product, software costs, the server costs, etc.","startTime":"15:19","endTime":"15:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it was an extremely uphill battle, like, why in the world am I paying a recurring price for this thing?","startTime":"15:26","endTime":"15:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Thing.","startTime":"15:30","endTime":"15:31","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let me just buy the thing.","startTime":"15:31","endTime":"15:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And like we just got told like, no over and over.","startTime":"15:32","endTime":"15:35","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And at some point were like, okay, we should just give in and just like, let's meet the customer where they are.","startTime":"15:35","endTime":"15:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But, but I think like we said, okay, look, we're going to hold our account and like, let's get a couple customers that can be successful.","startTime":"15:39","endTime":"15:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We made them successful.","startTime":"15:45","endTime":"15:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We did case studies with them.","startTime":"15:46","endTime":"15:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then when we talked to our third customer, of course we had the same pushback.","startTime":"15:47","endTime":"15:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But now we have a case study, a couple case studies and then they're like, okay, fine, we'll take a bet.","startTime":"15:50","endTime":"15:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And, and now I think like, of course we still get that question.","startTime":"15:54","endTime":"15:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every single customer.","startTime":"15:56","endTime":"15:57","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we have very good evidence across so many different customers why robotics as a service is useful.","startTime":"15:57","endTime":"16:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And people are like, okay, great.","startTime":"16:02","endTime":"16:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But even within the robotics service model is like, okay, well when you're charging like we kind of charge like value based pricing a little bit less than labor.","startTime":"16:04","endTime":"16:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's like, okay, well you guys are charging a little bit less than labor.","startTime":"16:13","endTime":"16:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's just too Expensive.","startTime":"16:16","endTime":"16:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Why are we even doing this?","startTime":"16:18","endTime":"16:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"16:20","endTime":"16:20","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so then we had to figure out what is the roi?","startTime":"16:20","endTime":"16:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Why do we they care and like we kind of like show them very visually.","startTime":"16:23","endTime":"16:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Here's the roi.","startTime":"16:26","endTime":"16:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think to your point, like product market fit and pricing model is actually all very related.","startTime":"16:28","endTime":"16:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Once we kind of nailed down the exact robotics pricing, we have these case studies, the sales velocity just like accelerated so much.","startTime":"16:34","endTime":"16:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Whereas like early days the same product more or less was like painfully hard to sell.","startTime":"16:41","endTime":"16:46","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One thing I'd just add is like fundamentally pricing is highly iterative and you're going to see that probably over the course of time.","startTime":"16:47","endTime":"16:54","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like we've been fortunate to partner with companies that are in like 7 million of ARR to seeing them in hundreds of millions of ARR.","startTime":"16:54","endTime":"17:00","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And those businesses that we have worked with have probably iterated with their pricing model, you know, dozens of times.","startTime":"17:00","endTime":"17:06","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you know, it comes with obviously pros and cons in terms of how.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:09","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"To navigate that with your customer.","startTime":"17:09","endTime":"17:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the reason they do that is recognizing that different chapters or different stages of the business are depending on the market.","startTime":"17:11","endTime":"17:16","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Especially if you're a data centric consumption product, like how do you shift from connector based pricing or seat based pricing to usage based pricing.","startTime":"17:16","endTime":"17:25","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And you're obviously seeing AI impact and we change that in terms of how businesses are more and more usage based or beer based in terms of their kind of consumption.","startTime":"17:25","endTime":"17:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so it's a constant iterative kind of process.","startTime":"17:34","endTime":"17:36","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And even within those usage based models, like you're seeing businesses think about different thresholds, different credit limits, different what have you tiers to think about, what are the right ways to gain and future gate products to get them to upsell and grow.","startTime":"17:36","endTime":"17:49","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so it's always going to be an iterative process.","startTime":"17:49","endTime":"17:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I think listening to the core frameworks that kind of alluded to, I think would kind of set you up for a lot of success in terms.","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"17:59","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Of being able to do that in the day.","startTime":"17:59","endTime":"18:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It comes down to what you're hearing from your customers and then obviously unpacking, you know, what the competitive landscape also looks like as well.","startTime":"18:01","endTime":"18:07","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Great, we'll take that one over here.","startTime":"18:09","endTime":"18:10","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Other side.","startTime":"18:10","endTime":"18:11","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Hi, thank you for sharing your experience.","startTime":"18:11","endTime":"18:14","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Eye opening.","startTime":"18:15","endTime":"18:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of the topics that was interesting.","startTime":"18:16","endTime":"18:18","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is that in this era of AI.","startTime":"18:18","endTime":"18:20","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You mentioned that the traditional lean launch pad type of approach may break and there's got to be some extra adaptations that needs to be in place when finding the product market fit.","startTime":"18:20","endTime":"18:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Could you explain a little bit about that?","startTime":"18:34","endTime":"18:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I didn't really Understand that difference.","startTime":"18:37","endTime":"18:40","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Expand on that.","startTime":"18:41","endTime":"18:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"18:44","endTime":"18:44","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Since I said it, I think I'll try to prepare.","startTime":"18:45","endTime":"18:48","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You guys can chime in.","startTime":"18:48","endTime":"18:49","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think the contrast that I was trying to draw, of course, there's timeless wisdom within those frameworks of you have to build some minimum viable version of your product, test it with your users through a beta, whether it's enterprise, B2B or consumers, and get market feedback that will help you learn what's working and what dimensions might be working along which you can build the product, develop further market fit.","startTime":"18:49","endTime":"19:18","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So I think all of that still stands.","startTime":"19:18","endTime":"19:20","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think the contrast today is just that one.","startTime":"19:21","endTime":"19:24","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's literally never been easier to build a lean prototype where all this effort used to.","startTime":"19:24","endTime":"19:30","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You go into, like, what is the latest prototype that you can build?","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"19:32","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, literally, it's so easy these days, right, to build an app, a landing page, a first version of a product, an agentic workflow, whatever it is, right, to test your idea.","startTime":"19:32","endTime":"19:43","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so I think more, you know, for me, there's more emphasis on the iterative aspect of it.","startTime":"19:43","endTime":"19:51","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You know, in other words, really in partnership with early design customers, with your users, you know, within your sort of enterprise, you know, potential customer base, just spending time to figure out, like, what is truly extremely valuable and essential, a core business workflow or a core utility in people's lives, and then figuring out, like, how to frankly construct a more durable version of that product.","startTime":"19:52","endTime":"20:20","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so I don't think it's entirely different, but to me, kind of the emphasis has shifted from, like, what does it take to ship a prototype?","startTime":"20:20","endTime":"20:28","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"To prototypes are easy.","startTime":"20:28","endTime":"20:29","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"What does it take to really build deeper workflows and durability into the product that you're developing at the end of the day?","startTime":"20:30","endTime":"20:38","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Does that help?","startTime":"20:38","endTime":"20:39","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"All right, we'll go to the other side here.","startTime":"20:41","endTime":"20:42","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Hi.","startTime":"20:43","endTime":"20:43","speaker_name":"speaker

the question is, when do I should start speaking with them and how do I triage them?","startTime":"20:52","endTime":"21:04","speaker_name":"speaker 5","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Because right now it

this.","startTime":"21:21","endTime":"21:22","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"My quick tip is just that, you know, VCs in general have gotten so good at sort of outbound and hitting people's inboxes, Whether it's through, you know, people or, you know, automated outrage, that you shouldn't assume that the amount of, first of all, is actual interest.","startTime":"21:23","endTime":"21:42","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You won't know what the actual interest is for investors to back our company until you make

to warm up those relationships, but really, instead of reacting to the ones that are in your inbox, I would spend some time researching who are the top investors in your particular space who are most

focus time really on spending, because you need kind of investor company fit as well, or those conversations won't convert.","startTime":"22:21","endTime":"22:28","speaker_name":"speaker
