working.","startTime":"05:56","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So those three markets are working for sure.","startTime":"06:02","endTime":"06:03","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And I think we sit around thinking, okay, they're working in two one, what's next, right verticals

right?","startTime":"06:45","endTime":"06:52","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now I've seen companies that are going fully vertical, right?","startTime":"06:52","endTime":"06:56","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So they're not just going to be some tool that someone, some knowledge worker uses.","startTime":"06:56","endTime":"07:00","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think that's going to be commoditized or rather it's going to be a lot of competition for that.","startTime":"07:00","endTime":"07:04","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But to take like an industry that is like insurance or a specific part of healthcare and go super deep and solve everything on the stack.","startTime":"07:04","endTime":"07:13","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's where a lot of the value is going to improve.","startTime":"07:13","endTime":"07:15","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think that's where it's going to be extracted.","startTime":"07:15","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because at the end of the day, this new technology is able to do real work.","startTime":"07:17","endTime":"07:21","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's the difference between this and then some line of code or some database back in the day or some web app or some mobile app.","startTime":"07:22","endTime":"07:27","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"This is, you know, real work is going to get done.","startTime":"07:28","endTime":"07:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the companies that figure out the fact that true verticalization of an industry that's deeply important to humanity, thinking they're extracting from them.","startTime":"07:30","endTime":"07:38","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think what Peter?","startTime":"07:39","endTime":"07:40","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I totally agree.","startTime":"07:40","endTime":"07:41","speaker_name":"speaker

model.","startTime":"07:51","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"What we see today appears to be talking about work is correct, replacing not the software, but the labor or the problem solving.","startTime":"07:54","endTime":"08:01","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So if a business process, step A, B, C, D and E. The first thing we're seeing you go from step A to step E faster using AI.","startTime":"08:01","endTime":"08:09","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think we want to see startups that go from step A to E skip steps B, C and D in the middle with some level of intelligence.","startTime":"08:09","endTime":"08:17","speaker_name":"speaker

work.","startTime":"11:28","endTime":"11:30","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"They're not working yet.","startTime":"11:31","endTime":"11:32","speaker_name":"speaker

that to start working soon.","startTime":"11:32","endTime":"11:38","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so there's companies that will either A, unlock that or B, take advantage of that wave.","startTime":"11:38","endTime":"11:43","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"11:43","endTime":"11:44","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think maybe the hottest thing I can offer is that I think that a lot of these Software, like the SaaS, subscription models, like all of those margins are going to get completely squeezed over time.","startTime":"11:44","endTime":"11:53","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think maybe that's more consensus now.","startTime":"11:53","endTime":"11:55","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But I think that's why I believe a lot of.","startTime":"11:55","endTime":"11:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because that's where you can really kind of defend that business model.","startTime":"11:58","endTime":"12:03","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But it's just so easy to create software nowadays.","startTime":"12:03","endTime":"12:06","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think that a consumer I've done actually I've actually worked in a lot of consumer companies.","startTime":"12:06","endTime":"12:11","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Instagram, Facebook, Uber and ChatGPT.","startTime":"12:13","endTime":"12:16","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I would say that it's going to be really hard for a company to break out right now because I think so much of those large companies are still innovating and kind of capturing the attention or the consumer demand.","startTime":"12:16","endTime":"12:28","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So despite working there, I actually do invest a lot in enterprise just because that is where I think the value is right now.","startTime":"12:28","endTime":"12:35","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But that could change over the next six to five months.","startTime":"12:35","endTime":"12:38","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:38","endTime":"12:39","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And also maybe while you were talking, when I originally joined Index, I focused on vertical software.","startTime":"12:39","endTime":"12:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's software built for one particular industry like for example Procore.","startTime":"12:44","endTime":"12:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's the operating system for construction or service titan, that's the operating system for the trades, toast for restaurants.","startTime":"12:48","endTime":"12:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think some of those industries that already have a really big incumbent that has the data and the distribution, I think AI will be a tailwind for those businesses.","startTime":"12:55","endTime":"13:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it'll be difficult for a point solution AI company to like come in and replace those.","startTime":"13:06","endTime":"13:11","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think there's a real opportunity for some of these incumbents to partner with latest and greatest AI startups via marketplace to help make sure that their customer base has access to some of the best AI technology.","startTime":"13:12","endTime":"13:23","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's probably another area that feels more.","startTime":"13:24","endTime":"13:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I do want to push back on that a little bit because I do think you want it to be spicy.","startTime":"13:27","endTime":"13:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"13:30","endTime":"13:31","speaker_name":"speaker

transition to AI.","startTime":"13:33","endTime":"13:38","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think that it's just too slow and I think that all of the top talent here are starting companies or joining startups because that's where all the alpha is.","startTime":"13:38","endTime":"13:47","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think that you know there is and you've seen this before.","startTime":"13:47","endTime":"13:51","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'll use Granola as it's a non portfolio

product.","startTime":"14:07","endTime":"14:08","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Do you think that's sustainable?","startTime":"14:08","endTime":"14:10","speaker_name":"speaker

distribution.","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"14:28","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think there are a lot of Companies in the mobile era that prove that if you're not mobile native, I don't think you're going to be durable.","startTime":"14:28","endTime":"14:34","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I think that there is something to be said if your founders are AI native and have that DNA their research.","startTime":"14:34","endTime":"14:40","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"A lot of research founders are very commercial.","startTime":"14:40","endTime":"14:43","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, one example I would say is Peerlike Labs and Doge and Liam are just extremely great researchers.","startTime":"14:43","endTime":"14:51","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But when we had dinner with them, we talked a lot about go to market because that's where their minds are going right now.","startTime":"14:51","endTime":"14:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so I think that if you have a ton of those really awesome, brilliant AI researchers who also really get business and product, that's where it's going to be very hard for anyone to come.","startTime":"14:57","endTime":"15:09","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think business and pride as an amalgamation of talent is always special.","startTime":"15:09","endTime":"15:14","speaker_name":"speaker

right?","startTime":"15:15","endTime":"15:24","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think just about Internet and then you know, web and web mobile errors like we tried new business models took root.","startTime":"15:24","endTime":"15:31","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And the most powerful way to be an incumbent is not just like slap mobile on top of a system record or slap AI on top of another system record is to change the business model, right?","startTime":"15:31","endTime":"15:41","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like Google change everything but say hey, we're just sell everything to monetize via ads more or less, right?","startTime":"15:41","endTime":"15:48","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That's kind of unfair.","startTime":"15:48","endTime":"15:49","speaker_name":"speaker

4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so if we can figure out a business model change using AI that's more powerful than quite frankly, you know, other distribution services.","startTime":"15:55","endTime":"16:03","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I agree with that.","startTime":"16:03","endTime":"16:04","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think the other thing we need to figure out is pricing because right now there's a lot of per se pricing.","startTime":"16:04","endTime":"16:09","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So not right now, but previously, I'll say six months and nine months ago, a lot of pricing, but that's really challenging because what you're doing is you're actually, you know, it's behind the scenes, the GPUs are cranky, they're running really hot, that costs money.","startTime":"16:09","endTime":"16:20","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so really we should be pricing on how much work is actually achieved.","startTime":"16:21","endTime":"16:24","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And people talk about outcomes based pricing, which I believe in, but there's also really weird perverse incentives if you're like kind of like, well put this tracking pixel there and let's see if you actually convert it.","startTime":"16:24","endTime":"16:33","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that because I think I'm still trying to figure out this pricing thing.","startTime":"16:34","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think we all agree that seek based pricing is dead and has to be some kind of outcome work based pricing because for the first time we actually have technology to do work.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"16:46","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Not just enable work, but do work.","startTime":"16:46","endTime":"16:48","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I think it's a phenomenal point.","startTime":"16:48","endTime":"16:50","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I really like the outcome space pricing, especially for things like customer support.","startTime":"16:51","endTime":"16:55","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, is the ticket resolved?","startTime":"16:55","endTime":"16:57","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay, you pay for it.","startTime":"16:57","endTime":"16:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then comes the question of true like margins over time.","startTime":"16:58","endTime":"17:02","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where does value accrue?","startTime":"17:03","endTime":"17:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean there was literally one moment where I think the zeitgeist in the venture capital community was like, should we just buy Nvidia and like Google stock at this point?","startTime":"17:04","endTime":"17:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, you know, and in the beginning a lot of these AI startups were raising money and they literally put on the slide like we're raising 15 million bucks, 8 million is going to compute, 7 million is to like hiring and you know, operations.","startTime":"17:12","endTime":"17:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think there's a big opportunity and I think we're still in the early innings to figure out what that pricing model will be.","startTime":"17:27","endTime":"17:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think the question is, you know, we talk a lot about product go to market fit, we talk about the unit value for both cost and unit value for pricing.","startTime":"17:33","endTime":"17:41","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think what Nina is referring to is like the unit value for AI as a consumer is not deterministic.","startTime":"17:41","endTime":"17:48","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's unknown.","startTime":"17:49","endTime":"17:49","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Depending on the context, the unit value could change.","startTime":"17:50","endTime":"17:52","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's not tokens, right?","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"17:53","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's fairly so that you can burn tokens and not create as much value as, you know, a difference.","startTime":"17:53","endTime":"17:59","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So I think we're still in the earliest stage to try to understand both what the unit value of scaling is.","startTime":"18:00","endTime":"18:05","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That's pretty clear, GPUs and tokens.","startTime":"18:05","endTime":"18:07","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But what's the unit value of customer value?","startTime":"18:07","endTime":"18:10","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It could be outcomes, it could be results.","startTime":"18:10","endTime":"18:11","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And I think founders out there that can figure it out and unlock this question, I think will have a tremendous opportunity ahead of them.","startTime":"18:13","endTime":"18:20","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And I wanted to talk about some of the startups because valuations are getting crazy.","startTime":"18:21","endTime":"18:26","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They're raising and growing faster, like so fast.","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:30","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is that good or bad?","startTime":"18:30","endTime":"18:32","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Good and bad.","startTime":"18:32","endTime":"18:33","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean I think the story, the end of this story is yet to be written.","startTime":"18:36","endTime":"18:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think it's incredible just to see like the new milestones of revenue growth.","startTime":"18:42","endTime":"18:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean when I first joined in the venture industry, it was like going from 0 to 1 was like best in class.","startTime":"18:47","endTime":"18:53","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"0 to 1 million in one year was like considered good.","startTime":"18:53","endTime":"18:56","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now it's like, you know, we have companies that are going from like 0 to 100 million in one year.","startTime":"18:57","endTime":"19:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I think the conversation becomes a lot around like quality of revenue and to the Valuation point.","startTime":"19:01","endTime":"19:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It is tough because we're in really what feels like uncharted territory if you look at public market stocks and where those market caps are.","startTime":"19:07","endTime":"19:15","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that there's this moment where if you look at what's happened to the venture asset class, there's just been so much capital that is flooded into the space from 2020 onward.","startTime":"19:16","endTime":"19:27","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It was like the crossover funds came in.","startTime":"19:27","endTime":"19:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There were many seed funds.","startTime":"19:29","endTime":"19:31","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Funds got bigger than ever before.","startTime":"19:31","endTime":"19:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think the question that everyone is asking is what's the reconciliation reconciling moment when these companies go public, how will they be valued?","startTime":"19:32","endTime":"19:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you really have to suspend this belief to invest in some of these projects prices.","startTime":"19:40","endTime":"19:45","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's why for all three of us, being early to the game is really important.","startTime":"19:45","endTime":"19:49","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we spent a ton of time getting to know founders at the pre seed level, participating or leading the seed, trying to lead the A.","startTime":"19:49","endTime":"19:57","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because after that it seems like just the wall of capital that comes in is enormous.","startTime":"19:57","endTime":"20:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that puts a lot of pressure on founders.","startTime":"20:03","endTime":"20:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, I always find it funny when founders are like, I really want to raise this round because it makes it easier to hire.","startTime":"20:05","endTime":"20:11","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'm like, the people that you're hiring know that their 409A is going to be much higher versus hiring now.","startTime":"20:11","endTime":"20:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so, you know, I think time will tell.","startTime":"20:17","endTime":"20:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I actually talked to a founder today who wanted a lower valuation.","startTime":"20:19","endTime":"20:22","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I won't say that was very surprising.","startTime":"20:23","endTime":"20:25","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I was not ready for that playbook.","startTime":"20:25","endTime":"20:27","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But for this right reason, like want to make sure you set the right expectations.","startTime":"20:27","endTime":"20:30","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It was a very experienced founder.","startTime":"20:31","endTime":"20:32","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"20:32","endTime":"20:33","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it is.","startTime":"20:33","endTime":"20:35","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, they're out there, you just got to go find them.","startTime":"20:35","endTime":"20:37","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I won't tell you where I found this one.","startTime":"20:38","endTime":"20:39","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Something I'm actually curious to know, do you see, I'm sure you see a lot of people revisiting old ideas now that AI has blown up.","startTime":"20:45","endTime":"20:53","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What are some interesting old ideas that you've seen be revisited in the past few years?","startTime":"20:53","endTime":"20:58","speaker_name":"speaker 1","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I would say just chat as a system engagement on top of system record has always existed, right?","startTime":"20:59","endTime":"21:05","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Slack tried to be that office operating system, remember?","startTime":"21:05","endTime":"21:10","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like Slack had every app inside of it and it didn't really work right, because like humans and AI can understand or talk back.","startTime":"21:10","endTime":"21:19","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But now chat as such engagement has been the de facto front door AI.","startTime":"21:19","endTime":"21:24","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It could be succeeded by video, in voice, other things.","startTime":"21:24","endTime":"21:26","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But say chat employs an interface, is now real.","startTime":"21:26","endTime":"21:31","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So remember like stuff came out and people go home.","startTime":"21:31","endTime":"21:34","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It kind of worked.","startTime":"21:34","endTime":"21:35","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Zero kind of worked.","startTime":"21:35","endTime":"21:36","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It didn't I would say with AI and LLM, text and chat and voice have to unlock real system engagements on top of other applications.","startTime":"21:36","endTime":"21:44","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And it's not as the old idea around for a while, but it's actually working now and because it works is enabling a bunch of different systems.","startTime":"21:44","endTime":"21:52","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"My latest obsession is AI enabled marketplaces.","startTime":"21:53","endTime":"21:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I love this, I love of all the parts of that place that worked, Uber was one of my favorite ones.","startTime":"21:58","endTime":"22:03","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Just because of how amazing the flywheels get on the, you know, demand side and the, and supply side.","startTime":"22:03","endTime":"22:11","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And once you get the right now we're seeing a lot of really amazing founders who are rebuilding marketplaces with AI at the same time.","startTime":"22:11","endTime":"22:21","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Well, yesterday we led the Series C in Core.","startTime":"22:21","endTime":"22:25","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's why Marketplace, I led the Series A in a company called Paraform, which is a different kind of hiring marketplace.","startTime":"22:25","endTime":"22:32","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There's one, I have a term sheet out which I won't tell you about right now, but I'm just checking my texts for another one.","startTime":"22:32","endTime":"22:39","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But I really do think this is really huge because again, remember, it's the first time technology can start to do work.","startTime":"22:39","endTime":"22:46","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you take a look at the pieces of the marketplace that can be automatable or even things that are supported well from AI.","startTime":"22:46","endTime":"22:54","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, Paraform is a great example.","startTime":"22:54","endTime":"22:56","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The fact that like you're able to now LLMs are great at reading a bunch of text, right?","startTime":"22:56","endTime":"23:00","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So you can now sort through a bunch of unstructured data and figure out exactly who this candidate might be a perfect fit for.","startTime":"23:00","endTime":"23:06","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that is, that's superpower, right?","startTime":"23:06","endTime":"23:09","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I, I, I think AI enabled marketplaces, if you really want to know, find a way to get in touch.","startTime":"23:09","endTime":"23:15","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'd love to talk to you.","startTime":"23:15","endTime":"23:16","speaker_name":"speaker

manually.","startTime":"24:53","endTime":"24:58","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And for years people have been like, oh, these industries don't buy technology, they're all like SMBs.","startTime":"24:58","endTime":"25:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But in fact if you zoom out, a lot of those businesses are quite large and they're run by

thinking about those types of things that are, you know, this is what I love doing as an investor too is think about the uncorrelated bets that we have in our portfolio.","startTime":"26:46","endTime":"26:54","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And something as physical as that is

cool.","startTime":"26:58","endTime":"27:01","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But that is one of those things that is strictly not AI that I think was going to come around the

revenue.","startTime":"27:18","endTime":"27:22","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think one of the conversations happening in boardrooms, especially with CFOs is the unpredictable nature of consumption based or outcomes based AI pricing because they want to be able to find forecast, okay, I'm going to spend X amount on this AI solution.","startTime":"27:23","endTime":"27:40","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that is I think really difficult.","startTime":"27:40","endTime":"27:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The other thing that has been really interesting is looking at companies that are doing like software for hardware where they've taken a lot of inspiration from like Datadog for example, which had a really unique pricing model with credits and figuring out like hey, what's the right way to think about either observing or understanding or enabling your underlying data.","startTime":"27:43","endTime":"28:03","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I think that's another conversation that's happening.","startTime":"28:04","endTime":"28:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I would say predictability is still something generally business operators deeply care about.","startTime":"28:06","endTime":"28:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think SaaS.","startTime":"28:13","endTime":"28:14","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"SaaS still continues to be able to business

be it physical systems around compute storage or security or robotics, you're going to see again return to software bundled hardware and that might be magnets, might be a robot, be a self driving car, but you're going to see I think that business model come back again and it might be monetized via subscription, but it's definitely going to be.","startTime":"28:41","endTime":"29:06","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"We're dealing with physical boxes and power

3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think that, can't forget that we still live in the physical.","startTime":"29:11","endTime":"29:14","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's going to be a great thing.","startTime":"29:14","endTime":"29:17","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then in that, along those lines, I think the healthcare sector is really interesting because we still have bodies and bodies deteriorate.","startTime":"29:17","endTime":"29:23","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We need to take care of them.","startTime":"29:23","endTime":"29:24","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so that is a very huge part of where I think some of the alpha will be.","startTime":"29:24","endTime":"29:29","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I guess in addition to that.","startTime":"29:30","endTime":"29:31","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I've already said this already, but I think the marketplace business model is fantastic because when you have the two flywheels or the two sides or three sides of the marketplace running, you get a lot of an advantage and you get pricing leverage and you get a big huge moat and advantage.","startTime":"29:31","endTime":"29:46","speaker_name":"speaker

right point where it's affordable.","startTime":"30:35","endTime":"30:45","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I mean you probably have to get some early design partners to be able

sense.","startTime":"30:52","endTime":"31:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think figuring out what those design partners get in return because they're probably not going to pay you that much if it's early is usually an important thing to do.","startTime":"31:07","endTime":"31:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And a lot of startups, if

for.","startTime":"31:33","endTime":"31:37","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And it's really hard to build a technology in search of a
