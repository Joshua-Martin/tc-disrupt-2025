# Building What’s Next with the Minds Behind Twitter and Meta

October 28, 2025, 02:03 pm

## Notes

### **Competitive Landscape and Market Positioning**
- The panel emphasized the ongoing competition among social media giants as less about defeating each other and more about capturing advertising spend from traditional media like TV and radio, highlighting a broader market opportunity (02:15).  
- **Adam** recalled an early Twitter-Facebook rivalry where both platforms aimed to shift ad dollars into digital rather than fighting each other directly.  
- **David** pointed out that disruption in social media requires a new "orthogonal graph" beyond existing social or interest graphs, making it hard for incumbents like Facebook or Twitter to be displaced in their current form (05:00).  
- The resilience of Twitter was attributed to its unique follower graph, which differed from phonebook-based social graphs, creating a defensible position even during outages (06:00).  
- The group agreed that disruption tends to come from smaller, innovative entrants rather than incumbents, emphasizing the importance of focusing on emerging trends rather than large players (08:00).
### **Venture Capital Strategy and Operator-Focused Investment Model**
- The founders created their VC firm to fill a gap in venture capital by emphasizing experienced operators who have scaled companies, particularly at the Series B stage, where product-market fit and scaling challenges are critical (09:30).  
- They highlighted their unique claim that, collectively, partners have grown companies from zero to **$123 billion** in annual recurring revenue (ARR), with **David** responsible for **$120 billion** of that (11:00).  
- **Dan** explained that traditional boards often lacked operator experience, resulting in unhelpful advice; the firm aims to provide founders with practical, battle-tested guidance from those who have scaled globally (11:30).  
- This operational experience enables them to advise on critical hires, such as CFOs with public company expertise, and on governance, exemplified by **Dan’s** bold move to restructure Twitter’s board to include operators, improving decision-making efficiency (14:00).  
- The founders see strong demand for operator-led boards now, as younger founders hit rapid growth earlier and face more complex scaling challenges (28:00).
### **Fundraising Environment and Valuation Dynamics**
- The panel outlined the current fundraising climate as highly active and aggressive but nuanced, with investors pouring money into winners while many others will fail, creating a "wildfire" rather than a classic bubble (16:00).  
- Recent examples include companies like **Open Evidence** raising $6 million three months after a **$3.5 billion valuation** and **Harvey** doubling its valuation from **$3 billion to $5 billion** in four months (16:30).  
- They noted that ARR and revenue growth rates in new startups are now approximately **three times higher** than in prior years, driving elevated valuations but also increasing pressure on companies to execute quickly (18:30).  
- The panel warned founders not to raise more money than necessary, as overly large rounds can cause operational distractions and loss of focus, citing **Ryan Peterson's** Twitter thread about the pitfalls of raising excess capital (20:00).  
- The traditional **“triple-triple-double-double-double”** revenue growth formula aiming for $100 million ARR is becoming obsolete, with IPO benchmarks rising closer to **$300 million ARR**, especially due to lower gross margins in AI companies (26:00).
### **Operational Challenges in Rapid Growth Companies**
- Rapid growth brings complex operational challenges that many founders underestimate, especially related to customer churn, product readiness, and founder-led sales models (29:30).  
- The panel stressed the importance of owning problems openly rather than hiding them during fundraising diligence to build trust and prepare effectively (29:50).  
- Many AI companies face consumption-based revenue models, requiring not just sales but ongoing customer engagement to drive usage, adding operational complexity beyond traditional SaaS (30:30).  
- The firm leverages expert networks to gather off-list customer feedback during due diligence, and founders are encouraged to proactively use these networks to understand market perceptions and competitive positioning (31:50).
### **Founder Advice on Governance, Fundraising, and Management Focus**
- Founders hold more leverage in board and fundraising negotiations than they often realize, especially when not in desperate financial situations (14:30).  
- **Dan** shared a case where he effectively excluded an uncooperative investor from Twitter’s board by changing the meeting location, illustrating founder control when exercised decisively (15:30).  
- Founders should manage outcomes, not processes, to avoid bureaucratic overload and maintain operational agility, ensuring clear ownership for results rather than enforcing rigid checklists (34:30).  
- On equity and fundraising, founders should balance dilution carefully and avoid raising excessive capital early, as maintaining meaningful ownership is critical for long-term motivation and control (33:50).  
- Regarding skepticism about advertising, **Adam** highlighted that while ad tech faces a tough market with many failures, the size of the marketing spend—**$1 trillion annually**—means significant opportunity remains for differentiated solutions, especially those with AI-driven advantages (36:00).
### **Market Insights and Industry Trends**
- The panel discussed how media consumption is shifting toward numerous small, engaging content formats, which are worth billions even if they seem niche or experimental (09:00).  
- The group cautioned against simplistic growth platitudes like “momentum is the only moat,” emphasizing that great companies can grow at different rates and success paths vary widely (23:00).  
- The evolving revenue models, especially in AI, require faster acceleration due to unique cost structures and gross margin profiles, pushing companies to scale more aggressively to reach sustainable profitability (27:00).  
- They noted the importance of focusing on inputs—like sales activity quality—rather than outputs alone, which is a key lesson from managing large sales teams and scaling revenue sustainably (25:30).
