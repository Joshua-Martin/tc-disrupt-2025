3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, about two thirds of the people we back are first time founders, which feels very kind of against the current moment where I think everyone's obsessed with repeat founders.","startTime":"01:50","endTime":"01:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But most of the people we back, first time founders, pre product market fit, pre launch, as we say at work, pre everything.","startTime":"01:59","endTime":"02:06","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So Wesley's one of the few people I know who has the courage to continue to back people at the earliest stage.","startTime":"02:06","endTime":"02:10","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I'm usually looking for a couple things.","startTime":"02:10","endTime":"02:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A founder who knows something special and unique about the problem they're solving.","startTime":"02:12","endTime":"02:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Also someone who has zero to one startup experience.","startTime":"02:17","endTime":"02:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it works a lot better if you spend time at a startup with 25 or fewer people before you do zero to one.","startTime":"02:19","endTime":"02:25","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then there's got to be a market where it feels like there's some inflection point

help.","startTime":"02:42","endTime":"02:43","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And that's a challenge, right?","startTime":"02:43","endTime":"02:45","speaker_name":"speaker

that come and say, I need my investors help to run my business.","startTime":"02:46","endTime":"02:50","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And that zero to one stage is really important.","startTime":"02:50","endTime":"02:53","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So what Charles said really about somebody has a clear vision and a clear ability to articulate what it takes to get from 0 to 1.","startTime":"02:53","endTime":"02:58","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then for me, from 1 to 100 or 100 to a billion.","startTime":"02:58","endTime":"03:01","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That's where like you, I really lean in and say, like, look, you've got this figured

business?","startTime":"03:05","endTime":"03:07","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I mean, we've learned the hard way, as in we've lost money by backing people who've had amazing careers at really large organizations where they have all of this ability to navigate politics and to figure out systems and get their hands on resources.","startTime":"03:07","endTime":"03:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then you put them in a room with no management, no instructions, no PRD, no OKRs, and a whiteboard and say, you figure it out.","startTime":"03:21","endTime":"03:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's paralyzing for them because all the things that made them successful and they're really fancy, big job don't apply to 01.","startTime":"03:29","endTime":"03:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then there's another challenge, which I noticed when investing very early on, is that folks from larger companies, there's a lot of infrastructure that solve that for this.","startTime":"03:37","endTime":"03:46","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, folks that, you know, come to me and say, hey, I worked at Google for 10, 20 years.","startTime":"03:46","endTime":"03:50","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Or if they're like working and managing this product, they sort of assume that there's distribution, right?","startTime":"03:50","endTime":"03:55","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Google has incredible distribution that was solved in the early days.","startTime":"03:55","endTime":"03:58","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And I got to play a very fantastic role learning how to solve distribution.","startTime":"03:58","endTime":"04:02","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But like, you ask them about, hey, how will you get 100 users, 100,000 users, 10,000 users, or even a million users?","startTime":"04:02","endTime":"04:08","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then, you know, the infrastructure just isn't there.","startTime":"04:08","endTime":"04:10","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so, you know, I think that zero to one stage, as you pointed out, is a very complicated thing.","startTime":"04:10","endTime":"04:14","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And it doesn't work well for people who haven't had the ability to go build that or learn from the start.","startTime":"04:14","endTime":"04:18","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"What did you say to a Google employee or meta employee who want to start a startup, given everything you just said, like, how can they get there?","startTime":"04:19","endTime":"04:27","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think it takes.","startTime":"04:28","endTime":"04:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And maybe this is like a little meta, like, no pun intended.","startTime":"04:29","endTime":"04:32","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It takes a certain amount of self awareness to say I can appreciate all of the resources I had at Meta, I had the brand, I had other people around, I had an IT department when my laptop broke, I had access to all of this distribution.","startTime":"04:33","endTime":"04:44","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And to be able to say, I recognize to Wesley's point, I'm not going to have all of these advantages.","startTime":"04:44","endTime":"04:48","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think you also have to care.","startTime":"04:49","endTime":"04:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I've met a lot of people who are doing very well at big companies.","startTime":"04:52","endTime":"04:54","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, well, I want to do a startup, but I kind of want to make 75% of what I make as an L whatever at this big company.","startTime":"04:54","endTime":"05:01","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'm like, do you want comfort or do you want an adventure?","startTime":"05:01","endTime":"05:05","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because starting a company from scratch is like not comfortable.","startTime":"05:05","endTime":"05:08","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't want to display it is not easy, it is not control, but it's an adventure.","startTime":"05:08","endTime":"05:12","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So usually I'm trying to find out, does this person want to go on an adventure.","startTime":"05:12","endTime":"05:16","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And anyone who's been an adventures are not up and to the right.","startTime":"05:16","endTime":"05:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Adventures are up and down and sometimes the down is really hard.","startTime":"05:19","endTime":"05:22","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I frankly met a lot of people at big companies where at the end of the meeting I'm like, I think you would be happier if you stayed where you were.","startTime":"05:22","endTime":"05:29","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The resources you have available to you at your company are pretty significant.","startTime":"05:30","endTime":"05:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I don't know that the idea that you're talking about is worth walking away from.","startTime":"05:35","endTime":"05:38","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wesley, would you bet this up on somebody who is coming out of Google or Meta or one of the large companies?","startTime":"05:39","endTime":"05:46","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the answer is yes.","startTime":"05:46","endTime":"05:48","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And there's actually one exception on generally what Charles said, which is, you know, sometimes people are too comfortable at large companies.","startTime":"05:48","endTime":"05:56","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"There's a.","startTime":"05:56","endTime":"05:57","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"They've worked on something where they have a unique insight about why the thing is completely broken.","startTime":"05:57","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, that's actually what, what I look for is what unique insight do we have?","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I was very lucky to have back to Canva and the Series A when 111 people said no, you know, nobody knew what they were building.","startTime":"06:05","endTime":"06:12","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And back then the product looked like a print shop, right?","startTime":"06:12","endTime":"06:15","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like you would go use it to make a set of business cards or you go use it to make a brochure for something and then you'd not use it again.","startTime":"06:15","endTime":"06:20","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Their churn was very high.","startTime":"06:20","endTime":"06:21","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But both Cliff and Nell totally understood what the unique insight was about why tools, the incumbents were all broken.","startTime":"06:21","endTime":"06:29","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And they basically said, look, you know, people under 35, like they grew up with a phone in their hands.","startTime":"06:29","endTime":"06:33","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's image first, there's a camera built into the Phone.","startTime":"06:33","endTime":"06:36","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The tools that are available to people, the things that were trained on, like Office or like Photoshop, they're like text first, right?","startTime":"06:36","endTime":"06:42","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, it's called Microsoft Word, for heaven's sake.","startTime":"06:42","endTime":"06:43","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So they basically said, like, we need to build something that is design and image first.","startTime":"06:44","endTime":"06:47","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That piece needs to happen.","startTime":"06:47","endTime":"06:48","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It wasn't until social media they had the immigration, the Canva Pro, where they turned on monetization and where people started using it constantly for both social media and their homework.","startTime":"06:48","endTime":"06:55","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"They nailed the distribution and they got people using it.","startTime":"06:55","endTime":"06:58","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But that unique insight was so clear in their head that nobody else understood.","startTime":"06:58","endTime":"07:01","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Most investors said, there's no way you're going to like ever disrupt Microsoft Office.","startTime":"07:01","endTime":"07:04","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"There's no way you're going to disrupt these tools.","startTime":"07:05","endTime":"07:06","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I was trained on for 35 years.","startTime":"07:06","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And what they didn't understand was the next generation was growing up going, I want design.","startTime":"07:08","endTime":"07:11","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I don't want to spend four years in yearbook class learning how to use Adobe tools so I can go into them.","startTime":"07:11","endTime":"07:15","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So that's the piece I look for.","startTime":"07:15","endTime":"07:17","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You worked on something of such a unique insight, and that unique insight says I, this is broken.","startTime":"07:17","endTime":"07:23","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"My company will never solve it.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:24","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"There's too much going in the way.","startTime":"07:24","endTime":"07:25","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's the same reason I was very fortunate to be on the team that helped to buy YouTube for Google.","startTime":"07:25","endTime":"07:29","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I looked, I was on the ads team at that point and we looked at it and you know, Google had its own tool, but Google was building it for pleasing all of the people that were like running media companies, they had drm.","startTime":"07:29","endTime":"07:40","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It was such a friction.","startTime":"07:40","endTime":"07:41","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Full tool to use has so much friction.","startTime":"07:41","endTime":"07:43","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then comes YouTube where they had unique insight going.","startTime":"07:43","endTime":"07:45","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You can upload any video, cat videos, piano videos, whatever you want.","startTime":"07:45","endTime":"07:47","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And there was no friction in doing it.","startTime":"07:47","endTime":"07:49","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And Google said like, oh, that's the right approach and that's why, you know, that deal went through.","startTime":"07:49","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So we look for the unique insight.","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:54","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And this is the piece that I, I care deeply about.","startTime":"07:54","endTime":"07:57","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's like, what is it that's broken that you feel that your company or that you're so motivated to go fix that you have this unique insight into it.","startTime":"07:57","endTime":"08:03","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I have one thing.","startTime":"08:03","endTime":"08:04","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"About half of the founders in our portfolio are spinning out of a company where to wealthy's point, they encounter some friction.","startTime":"08:05","endTime":"08:13","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sometimes it's a project that they really wanted to build and management didn't give them the resources.","startTime":"08:13","endTime":"08:17","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we look for people who've kind of banged into that problem.","startTime":"08:18","endTime":"08:21","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And oftentimes those people are not C suite People, they're individual contributors.","startTime":"08:21","endTime":"08:26","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're product managers, they're engineers.","startTime":"08:26","endTime":"08:28","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're not leadership.","startTime":"08:28","endTime":"08:30","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're always on the hunt for people who are actually in the trenches building stuff or accounting for problems and saying, wow, I think this problem is bigger than my boss and my boss's boss realized that this is something we could take out of our company and maybe build it for the industry.","startTime":"08:30","endTime":"08:42","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What do you look for founders, where there's no product and no traction?","startTime":"08:44","endTime":"08:48","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's like 90%.","startTime":"08:50","endTime":"08:51","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, 90% of like everything.","startTime":"08:51","endTime":"08:52","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Conception stage, like, I'd have no product, no traction.","startTime":"08:52","endTime":"08:55","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But do they have like an mvp?","startTime":"08:55","endTime":"08:57","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Do they have something because it's so easy to build this things now?","startTime":"08:57","endTime":"09:00","speaker_name":"speaker 3","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Well, it's easy.","startTime":"09:00","endTime":"09:01","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's easy now, but it wasn't easy 10 years ago.","startTime":"09:01","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And that's perfectly fine.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:05","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'd rather have a person that understands clearly what the insight is and what they're doing is going to change the world than a person who has an MVP that's still trying to discover a bunch of things and figure out why they're going to have product market.","startTime":"09:05","endTime":"09:14","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think it's maybe useful to contextualize, like what Wesley and I do every day.","startTime":"09:15","endTime":"09:19","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We're going to meet thousands of

interesting?","startTime":"09:28","endTime":"09:34","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do they have insights on this problem that feel novel?","startTime":"09:35","endTime":"09:37","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I hope I can leave you out with this idea of like, novelty.","startTime":"09:38","endTime":"09:41","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sometimes people present me ideas and I'm like, okay, I'm a

space.","startTime":"09:45","endTime":"09:47","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You tell me the problem, my brain starts going through, well, how would I solve this problem as a

2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I go, one of two things is probably true.","startTime":"09:57","endTime":"09:59","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Either this person hasn't studied the problem deeply enough to understand an interesting angle that sounds different than the other 10 people who pitched me on it, or this is a trivial problem to solve and there's no big business to be built here.","startTime":"09:59","endTime":"10:11","speaker_name":"speaker 2","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The one cabinet add to that I care deeply about.","startTime":"10:12","endTime":"10:15","speaker_name":"speaker 4","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"This is a very big first principle.","startTime":"10:15","endTime":"10:16","speaker_name":"speaker
