October 28, 2025, 10:31 am

## Notes

### **Early-Stage Investment Criteria**
- The main focus is backing founders with unique insights and proven ability to navigate the 0 to 1 startup phase.
- **Charles** emphasized that about **two thirds of their backed founders** are first-time founders, often pre-product or pre-market fit, highlighting the importance of founders who deeply understand the problem they are solving and have prior startup experience with companies of **25 or fewer people** (02:10)  
    - Founders must clearly articulate the path from idea to initial product to market traction, as investors avoid founders who rely heavily on investor help to run the business.  
    - Wesley added that founders from large companies often struggle adapting to a startup’s lack of resources and infrastructure, particularly distribution, which is critical at the 0 to 1 stage.  
    - Wesley also looks for founders with unique insights into broken systems that incumbents can’t fix, such as Canva’s focus on image-first design disrupting text-first legacy tools (06:30).  
    - Both investors agree that understanding how to solve the hardest problem—be it distribution, tech barriers, or monetization—is essential before scaling.
- **Wesley** stressed the importance of a founder’s unique insight as a key differentiator, citing examples like YouTube’s frictionless video upload versus Google’s restricted DRM model (07:20)  
    - About **half of their portfolio founders** come from within companies where they encountered friction or unmet needs, often as individual contributors rather than executives (07:50).  
    - Wesley warns against crowded markets with many similar players, especially in AI, where lack of monopoly or differentiation drives pricing and margins to zero (11:00).  
    - He highlighted that many competitive red oceans produce no winners due to poor unit economics or hype without sustainable value (13:00).
### **Founder Background and Pedigree**
- Founder pedigree and prior career paths are not prioritized; instead, unique insights and grit matter most.
- Both Charles and Wesley agree that **pedigree is irrelevant or even misleading** in most cases, as many successful founders lack elite education or big tech backgrounds (18:00)  
    - Canva’s founders were former high school teachers from Australia with no Silicon Valley pedigree, yet built one of the most valuable companies by focusing on a unique product and bottom-up go-to-market strategy (18:30).  
    - Wesley noted that pedigree is often an intellectual shortcut investors use to triage deals but can limit the diversity of successful founders and ideas (20:30).  
    - Charles explained that pedigree founders often follow safer, consensus paths and might avoid the high-risk decisions required for breakthrough startups (21:30).  
    - Pedigree primarily influences **investor access and meeting prioritization**, not necessarily investment decision quality (22:50).
- Charles highlighted that **many successful founders do not fit standard profiles** and that intellectual horsepower combined with wisdom from experience and “scar tissue” shapes better judgment and leadership (31:00)  
    - Younger founders are assessed more on emotional intelligence and leadership potential than IQ alone, as they must build and lead teams (30:50).  
    - Wisdom helps founders avoid chasing trends or making poor decisions based on superficial information.
### **Fundraising Strategy and Investor Selection**
- Founders should minimize dilution early on and carefully choose long-term, trustworthy investors aligned with their needs.
- For pre-seed rounds, selling more than **15% equity** to friends and family plus pre-seed investors is rare and risky, as founders need to retain motivation and leave room for future rounds (33:30)  
    - Wesley advised bootstrapping when possible to avoid unnecessary dilution before product market fit.  
    - Founders must raise enough to solve their company’s hardest problem, not just easy or surface issues, to prove product-market fit and distribution (35:00).  
- When choosing venture capital partners, trust and longevity are paramount since founders are often stuck with investors for **up to 10 years** (37:00)  
    - Wesley stressed selecting partners with proven track records and staying power to avoid disruptive or unhelpful investors later.  
    - Fit depends on what founders want beyond money: mentorship, customer introductions, or operational support (38:30).  
    - Large firms may have many junior partners with high turnover, so founders should prioritize stable, experienced partners.
### **Networking and Access Challenges**
- Building relationships and gaining investor access require hustle and leveraging introductions, especially for founders outside major hubs.
- Wesley and Charles agreed that cold emails rarely lead to investment meetings; introductions from trusted sources carry more weight (24:00)  
    - Wesley uses “metadata” from known founders or investors to qualify referrals and prioritize meetings (24:20).  
    - Founders without connections face a bigger challenge and must hustle by traveling, attending conferences, and building local networks to gain access (40:00).  
    - Serendipity plays a role, but sustained effort is critical for founders from outside major ecosystems like San Francisco (26:20).
- Both investors value founders who close the loop transparently when not investing, helping maintain goodwill and possible future introductions (27:00).
### **Product Vision and Market Strategy**
- Investors favor founders with clear, long-term visions and plans that disrupt existing markets or create new ones.
- Wesley looks for founders who think big with **100-year plans** reflecting deep understanding of how the world will change over decades (15:30)  
    - This vision helps founders build enduring companies that shape new markets rather than just short-term trends.  
    - He cited founders like Larry Sergey at Google and Canva’s co-founders as examples of this long-term strategic thinking.  
- Product-market fit centers on solving real, valuable problems that customers will pay for, supported by early evidence or prototypes (34:00)  
    - Founders must clearly articulate the customer journey, pain points, and why their solution is indispensable.  
    - Success requires focusing on the hardest problems first, such as distribution or technical barriers, rather than easier but less critical tasks (35:00).  
- Charles stressed the importance of founders having expert domain knowledge or unique expertise early on, enabling them to teach investors something new and compelling (17:30).
### **Market Dynamics and Competitive Positioning**
- Monopoly or near-monopoly status through unique insights or patents is highly valued, while crowded markets with many similar players are avoided.
- Wesley emphasized that companies with monopoly power, whether natural or government-granted (e.g., biotech patents), allow pricing control and sustainable margins (10:35)  
    - Markets with many competitors, like legal AI or grocery delivery during the pandemic, often result in race-to-zero pricing and no winners (13:00).  
    - Founders must understand the market’s competitive landscape and how their company is meaningfully different to justify investment.  
- The investors have avoided many crowded markets and prefer bets on companies with unique distribution channels or business models that separate them from competitors (11:30).  
    - Examples include meeting recording tools competing against Zoom’s embedded features, where differentiation creates viable business opportunities despite dominant incumbents (14:20).

## Action items

##### **Unassigned**
- Founders to carefully structure pre-seed fundraising rounds to limit friend/family dilution to ~15% and prefer bootstrapping where feasible (32:40)
- Founders preparing zero-to-one pitches to clearly articulate customer pain points, value proposition, and demonstrate solving the hardest problems early (34:41)
- Founders should prioritize selecting VC partners with long-term commitment and trustworthy relationship potential over firm reputation (37:03)
- Founders to define and communicate non-financial expectations (mentorship, support, etc.) when engaging with investors (38:38)
- International or non-networked founders to actively network by traveling, relocating if possible, and leveraging any introductions to overcome access challenges (39:40)
